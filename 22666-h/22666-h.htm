    <h2>
      CHAPTER ONE&mdash;THE TRYING-OUT OF ONE RODNEY PARKER, ASSISTANT ENGINEER
    </h2>
    <p>
      All at once the stump-dotted, rocky hillside became clamorous and
      animated. From the little shacks sheathed with tarred paper, from the
      sodded huts, from burrows sunk into the hillside men suddenly came popping
      out with shrill cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men, shouldering surveying instruments, stopped in their tracks on
      the freshly-heaped soil of a new railroad embankment, and gazed up at the
      hillside. The railroad skirted its foot and the sudden activity on the
      slope was in full view. &ldquo;Your lambs seem to be blatting around the
      fodder-rack once more, Parker,&rdquo; observed the man who lugged the transit.
      He was a thin, elderly man and his tone was somewhat satirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were running toward a common center, uttering cries in shrill
      staccato and sounding like yelping dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker drove the spurs of his tripod into the soft soil and stared up at
      the hillside, his tanned brow puckering with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think there's much of the lamb to that rush,&rdquo; observed the third
      man; &ldquo;they sound to me more like hyenas after raw meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be Dominick they'll eat, then,&rdquo; said the elderly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you put the Old Harry into 'em last week when you took their
      part and straightened out Dominick's bill of fare,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They
      probably think they can get quail on toast now if they yap for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in letting dagoes fight it out among themselves,&rdquo; announced the
      third man with much derision. &ldquo;Helping one of 'em is like picking a hornet
      out of a puddle. You'll get stung while doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men on the hillside had knotted themselves into a jostling group
      before the door of a long, low structure sheathed with tarred paper like
      the shacks. In the sunshine an occasional glint flashed above their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, their stingers are out,&rdquo; remarked the elderly man drily. &ldquo;If they've
      got Dominick cornered in that eating camp I'm thinking this will be the
      day that he'll get his&mdash;&mdash;whatever it is, they've laid up for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised me there should be no more weevils and no more spoiled meat,&rdquo;
       cried the one who had been addressed as Parker, a young man whose earnest
      face now expressed deep trouble. &ldquo;As matters were going, those Italians
      were half starved and doing hardly half a day's work in nine hours. Their
      padrone was putting the food rake-off into his own pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not backing up Dominick,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But when you took the
      men's part and laid down the law to him on the grub question you gave them
      their cue for general rebellion. Ten chances to one the padrone has done
      as he agreed. I reckon you scared him enough for that. Now they're
      probably around with knives looking for napkins and sparkling red wine. I
      tell you, Parker, you're inviting trouble when you go to boosting up what
      you call the oppressed multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a pretty hard view to take of the world and the people in it, Mr.
      Searles,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;There ought to be a bit of merit and
      encouragement in a man's going out of his way to right a wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Parker, I'm hired as construction engineer on the P. K. &amp; R.
      railroad system and I've worked for the road a good many years and found
      that I get along best when I am attending strictly to my own business in
      my own line. I told you at the time you butted into that dago row you were
      laying up trouble either for yourself or for some one else&mdash;and I
      guess it's some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A series of pistol shots popped smartly on the hillside, the reports
      partly muffled by the thin walls of the shack. The cries of the men
      outside became shrieks. The next instant the side wall bellied outward and
      then burst asunder. A man came hustling through the opening, evidently
      self-propelled, for he struck lightly on his feet and began to run down
      the steep hill. A soiled canvas apron fluttered at his waist. Stones
      rained after him. The knot of men at the door scattered like quicksilver
      and howling runners pursued him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably fear helped him as much as agility, for he kept well ahead of the
      rout, leaped a low fence at the bottom of the hill, scurried across a
      little valley and came floundering up the soft soil of the railroad
      embankment, scrambling toward the little group of engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Dominick,&rdquo; said Searles. &ldquo;There seems to be a little more work cut
      out for you in your side line of philanthropist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it whatta you say,&rdquo; screamed the man as his head came over the edge
      of the embankment. &ldquo;Nice! Good! All good to eat. But they want mucha more&mdash;too
      mucha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck himself repeated blows on the breast with one fist and pointed
      with the other hand at the men who came swarming up the side of the graded
      road bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You coma look&mdash;look to the nice br-read, meat all good, beer&mdash;plenty
      much to eat, dr-rink!&rdquo; the padrone gasped in appeal, as he circled about
      Parker to put him between the rioters and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who came after, screaming and cursing, jerking their arms above
      their heads, rolling back their lips from their yellow teeth, were
      apparently so many lunatics whose frenzy was not to be stayed. But
      undisciplined natures whose excesses spring from lack of self control are
      all the more ready to respond to the masterful control of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all the men recognized in Parker the champion who had won their
      first rights from the padrone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped their shrill vituperation and, crowding about him, began to
      bleat their explanations and appeals. But he threw out his arms, pushed
      them back a safe distance from the panting Dominick and roared them into
      silence, brandishing his fists, as he would have quelled a noisy school.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they understood that he wished them to be quiet they were silent, all
      leaning forward, their eyes shining, their lips apart, their fists
      clinched as tho they were holding their tongues in leash by that means,
      their dark, brown faces alight with wistful, almost palpitating eagerness.
      The regard they fixed on his face was baleful in its intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looka what they do,&rdquo; yelled Dominick rushing to his side. He had stripped
      his sleeve back from his arm. Blood was trickling from a knife gash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the tumult broke out again from the crowd. Two men leaped forward
      shaking their hats in their hands and screaming assertions and pointing
      quivering fingers at bullet holes in the crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; barked the young man. The presence of the satiric and
      unsympathetic old engineer nerved him to settle the dispute, if he might.
      The hint from the other that he had been meddling in what was outside his
      business gave him an uncomfortable sense of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About face and back to the camp,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I will look at your dinner
      and we shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hesitated a moment, but he went among them, pushing them down the
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed with the padrone behind the jabbering throng, and the two
      engineers came along at his earnest request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Searles,&rdquo; said Parker after a little while, as they walked side by
      side, &ldquo;being an older and wiser man than I am you are probably right in
      suggesting that I did wrong in interfering in this affair at the outset.
      But,&rdquo; he half-chuckled, &ldquo;I am going to lay the blame on my professor in
      sociology. He set me to thinking pretty hard in college and I guess I
      haven't been out from under his influence long enough to get hardened into
      the selfish views of my fellowman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was earnestness under his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;I am not blaming you for what you have done for
      the poor devils. But I have been all for business in my life. Business
      hasn't seemed to mix well with philanthropy. I haven't dared to think of
      what I ought to do. I have thought only of what I had to do, to earn a
      living for my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;if the P. K. &amp; R. folks decide that I've been
      meddling in matters that are none of my business I have no family to
      suffer for my indiscretion&mdash;but I have prospects and I know that a
      discharged man is worse off than a man who has started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder man patted Parker's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it stands now&mdash;and I'm speaking as a friend, young man, and not
      as a captious critic&mdash;you have set this Italian camp all askew by
      giving them countenance in the first place. They haven't any regulators in
      their heads, you see! When you're feeding charity to that kind of ruck
      you've got to be careful Parker, that they don't trample you down when
      they rush for the trough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man walked along up the hillside in silence. But just as they
      arrived in front of the long camp the scowl of puzzled hesitation
      disappeared from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As old Uncle Flanders used to say,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;'When a man sticks his
      finger into a tight knot-hole he'd better pull it out mighty quick, before
      it swells, even if he does leave some skin on the edges.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men halted and grouped themselves about the door. Their eager looks
      and nudgings of each other showed plainly that they expected their
      champion to take up their cause against the padrone once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dominick prudently halted at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go look for yourself, Sir Engineer,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;on the kettle, in
      the table all about and you see whatta I feed to those beasts when I try
      to satisfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men retorted in shrill chorus leaping about and gesticulating till
      their joints snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker resolutely pushed through the throng without trying to understand
      what they were saying to him and slammed the door in the faces of the few
      who attempted to crowd in with him. Those who anxiously peered through the
      windows saw him examine the food set out on the table for the noon meal,
      lift the covers from the stew pans on the rusty stove and then pass into
      the little building behind the main camp. The great stone ovens for the
      bread-baking were located there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he came out he faced them with grim visage, squared the
      shoulders that had borne many a football assault and called to Dominick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go inside,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and coax those two helpers of yours out of those
      ovens. They couldn't understand my Italian. Tell them that they are safe.
      Let the padrone through, men! Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd sullenly parted and Dominick trotted up the lane they left,
      hastening with apprehensive shruggings of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go about your work,&rdquo; said Parker, clutching his arm a moment as the
      padrone hastened past. &ldquo;I can see it isn't your fault this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; he cried, turning to the throng, &ldquo;few words and short so that
      you may all understand. Dominick's dinner is good. Good as any in the line
      boarding camps. I'm going to eat here. You come in and eat too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mumbling began among them and immediately it swelled into a jabbering
      chorus as the few who understood translated his words to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped down off the muddy stoop and strode among them, cuffing this one
      and that of those malcontents who were noisiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man certainly understands dago nature,&rdquo; muttered Searles to
      the other engineer. &ldquo;A club, good grit and a hard fist will drive them
      when a machine gun wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood up for you when you were not used right,&rdquo; shouted the young man.
      &ldquo;He has given you what I told him to give you&mdash;what you asked for. Go
      in there and get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew who the ring-leaders in the mutiny were and he drove those into
      the camp first. The others followed. In five minutes they were all at
      their places at table munching quietly. Another man, even with equal
      determination, might have not succeeded. But the greediest grumbler among
      them understood that this young man had first been as valiant to secure
      their rights as he was now ready to curb their rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own heart he was loathing this role of arbiter and mentor. His
      first interference had come out of his natural sense of justice. He had
      pitied this herd of men who had been so helplessly appealing against their
      wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood at one end of the room now and gazed at them, he realized with
      a little pang of self-reproach that his latest exploit had been prompted
      by as much of a desire to set himself right with the company as to square
      the padrone's critical case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when they were trudging down the hill together Searles said with a
      little touch of malice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a philanthropist, Parker, you seem to relish rough-house about as
      well as any one I ever saw, I've heard for a long time that football makes
      prizefighters out of college boys&mdash;so much so that they go looking
      for trouble. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd let the matter drop, Mr. Searles,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I'm
      thoroughly ashamed of the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was going to say,&rdquo; went on the elderly man, &ldquo;that civil engineers
      in these days get just as good wages without being shoulder-hitters.
      You'll get along faster on the peace basis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Parker's reflection two days later when he was in the room of the
      chief engineer of the P. K. &amp; R. system, at the company's general
      offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the chief, after his subordinate had finished his
      regular report, &ldquo;Mr. Jerrard wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard was general traffic manager and chief executive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young engineer went slowly down the long corridor, apprehension
      gnawing at his heart. He huskily muttered his name to the clerk at the
      grilled door and was admitted. He fairly dragged his feet along the strip
      of matting that led to the general manager's private office. It was like
      the Bridge of Sighs to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker, eh?&rdquo; repeated the general manager, whirling in his chair and
      letting his eyeglasses drop against his plump &ldquo;front elevation,&rdquo; as Parker
      whimsically termed it in his thoughts, even in this moment of his
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard gazed at him for a little while, a rather curious expression in
      his eyes under their shaggy gray brows, then whirled back to his desk and
      scrabbled among his papers. He drew forth a sheet of memoranda, gave
      Parker another shrewd glance and inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, sir, that you have been interfering in the padrone system of
      the construction department?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose what I did might be termed that, tho I wasn't intending to be
      meddlesome, Mr. Jerrard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in general instructions, was there, to lead a cub assistant in
      the engineering corps to revise a boarding house bill of fare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it further mentioned that you were back next day and herded about
      seventy-five Italians into a victualling camp as you would drive steers to
      a fodder rack. Don't you know that we reserve that sort of business for a
      squad of police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jerrard,&rdquo; said the young man, recovering some of his self-possession
      tho his tone was apologetic, &ldquo;since I have been on the road I saw what
      happened once when the police came with their clubs and revolvers. There
      was a free fight and two men were killed. I thought I saw a chance for one
      man to arbitrate a little difficulty&mdash;and arbitration is pretty
      highly recommended in these days by good authorities. When I found that
      arbitration didn't make things stay put I meddled once more in order to
      undo my first mistake&mdash;if we may call it that. It probably was a
      mistake, looked at officially. But you see&mdash;&rdquo; his voice faltered a
      little, for the manager was surveying him with rather a hard look in his
      eyes, &ldquo;I hoped that putting the padrone into line on his food question
      would prevent a strike; when I drove the men to table I had only the
      interests of the road at heart, for the strike was then fairly on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the manager, a bit of a smile at the corners of his mouth,
      &ldquo;you certainly were not thinking very hard of your own interests when you
      went into that rabid gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see that I made a botch of it generally, Mr. Jerrard. I will save
      you the trouble of requesting my resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as he bowed and turned Jerrard spoke sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, young man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As the executive of the P. K. &amp; R,
      system it wouldn't be exactly official and proper in me to approve your
      judgment in that matter of the Italians; but as a man&mdash;plain man,
      now, you understand,&mdash;I know grit when I see it and&mdash;&rdquo; he
      dropped his bluff stiffness got out of his chair and came along and
      squeezed Parker's muscular arm, &ldquo;you've got a brand of it that I admire.
      Yes, I do. No mistake! But that is just between you and me. That is simply
      my own personal opinion. I don't believe the directors relish the idea of
      gladiators in the engineering corps. Just respect this little private hint
      of mine hereafter please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He surveyed the young man with twinkling and appreciative eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;once in a while there comes up in the railroad
      business a demand for a man who has brains and spunk and muscle all rolled
      up in one bundle. I haven't tested you out yet on the first named but the
      chief engineer speaks in your behalf. The last two you certainly have.
      There's the story of a man who was going home late at night and picked up
      what he thought was a kitten and found it to be a pole-cat. It was good
      judgment to set it down again mighty sudden. But the skin was worth
      something and he resolved to have the skin to pay for the damage. Now
      President Whittaker and myself have been up in the north woods this season&mdash;among
      the big game, you understand. We picked up what we thought was a kitten.
      It has turned out to be something else. But we are not going to drop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young engineer was looking at him with puzzled gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand a bit of it, do you?&rdquo; laughed the traffic manager.
      &ldquo;Well, I can't explain the thing just yet. I'll simply leave it this way
      today: Do you want to take a pole-cat and skin it for us? I don't mean by
      that that it's a job that any enterprising young man should be ashamed or
      afraid of. It's a job in your line. It's something of close personal
      interest to the president of this system and myself. It is going to take
      you away into the big woods. Do you want it&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer hesitated only a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the boy!&rdquo; cried Jerrard. His tone was so enthusiastic that
      Parker's instinct told him that this bluff offer was another test of his
      readiness in an emergency and had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager put his hand against his shoulder and gently pushed him out of
      the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get ready for a cold winter out of doors and practice your tongue on the
      names To-quette Carry' and 'Colonel Gideon Ward' until you are not afraid
      of the sound of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a chuckle he shut the door on the astonished young man, but opened it
      again before Parker had moved from the mat outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be worried, my boy, because I cannot explain the whole situation
      today.&rdquo; There was kindly reassurance in his tones. &ldquo;You'll make out all
      right, I'm sure of that.&rdquo; A queer little smile puckered the corners of his
      eyes and his voice again became teasing. &ldquo;The idea is, you've taken a
      contract to do up the Gideonites of the Wilderness in a lone-handed job.
      But I think you're good for the trick.&rdquo; He shut the door again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWO&mdash;THE WHIM THAT PROJECTED THE FAMOUS &ldquo;POQUETTE CARRY
      RAILROAD&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Weeks passed before Rodney Parker got any more light on the matter in
      which he had blindly given his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood this silence better when the situation was set before him at
      last. There are some projects that captains of industry dilate upon with
      pride. But big men are cautious about letting the world know their whims.
      And whims that lead to exasperating complications that no business
      judgment has provided for, do not form pleasant topics for conversation or
      publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many railroad projects have been launched, some of them unique, but never
      before was enterprise conceived in just the spirit that gave the Poquette
      Carry Railway to the transportation world. There have been railroads that
      &ldquo;began somewhere and ended in a sheep pasture.&rdquo; The Poquette Carry Road,
      known to the legislature of its state as &ldquo;The Rainy-Day Railroad,&rdquo; is even
      more indifferently located, for it twists for six miles, from water to
      water, through as tangled and lonely a wilderness as ever owl hooted in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it has two of the country's railroad kings behind it and at its
      inception some very wrathful lumber kings were ahead of it, and the final
      and decisive battle that was fought was between the champions of the
      respective sides&mdash;an old man and a young one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man had all the opinionated conservatism of one who despises new
      methods and modern progress as &ldquo;hifalutin and new-fangled notions.&rdquo; The
      young man, fresh from a school of technology and just completing an
      apprenticeship under the engineers of a big railroad system, had not an
      old-fashioned idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man came roaring from the deep woods, choleric, impatient of
      opposition, and flaming with the rage of a tyrant who is bearded in his
      own stronghold for the first time. The young man advanced from the city to
      meet him with the coolness of one who has been taught to restrain his
      emotions, and armed with determination to win the battle that would make
      or break him, so far as his employers were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard was the avant-courier of this novel railroad. Jerrard had been
      traffic-manager of the great P. K. &amp; R. system for many years, and
      when he grew bilious and &ldquo;blue&rdquo; and very disagreeable, the doctor told him
      to go back into the woods so far that he would not think about tariff or
      rebates or competition for two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard chose Kennegamon Lake. A New England general passenger-agent whom
      he had met at a convention told him about that wilderness gem, and lauded
      it with a certain attractiveness of detail that made Jerrard anxious to
      test the veracity of New England railroad men, whose &ldquo;fishin'-story&rdquo;
       folders he had always doubted with professional scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey by rail was a long one, and it afforded leisure for so much
      cogitation that when Jerrard napped he dreamed that the ends of his nerves
      were nailed to his desk back in the P. K. &amp; R. general offices, and
      that as he proceeded he was unreeling them as a spider spins its thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the train at Sunkhaze station he was still worrying as to
      whether the assistant traffic-manager would be able to beat the O. &amp;
      O. road on the grain contract. In thinking it over about a month later it
      occurred to him that he had dropped all outside affairs right there on
      that station platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place the mosquitoes and black flies were waiting. He had
      never seen or felt black flies before. He would have scouted the idea that
      there were insects no bigger than pinheads that in five minutes would have
      his face streaming with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do just love the taste of city sports,&rdquo; said the guide. &ldquo;We old
      sanups ain't much of a delicacy 'long side of such as you. Here, let me
      put this on.&rdquo; He daubed the white face of the city man with an
      evil-smelling compound of tar and oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard's mind was rapidly freeing itself from transportation worries.
      Then came the long paddle across Spinnaker Lake, with only the unfamiliar
      insecurity of a canoe beneath him, and after that the six-mile Poquette
      carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Jerrard had forgotten the P. K. &amp; R. entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe and duffel went across the carry slung upon a set of wheels.
      Jerrard rode in the low-backed middle seat of a muddy buck-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheels ran against boulders, grated off with indignant &ldquo;chuckering&rdquo; of
      axle-boxes, hobbled over stumps and plowed through &ldquo;honey-pots&rdquo; of mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake,&rdquo; gasped Jerrard, holding desperately to the seat,
      &ldquo;why don't you get into the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver, a French-Canadian turned and displayed an appreciative grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eet ban de ro'd vat you saw de re,&rdquo; he explained, pointing his whip to
      the thoroughfare they were pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This a road?&rdquo; demanded Jerrard, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui, eet ban a tote-road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of this kind before,&rdquo; ejaculated Jerrard, between bumps,
      &ldquo;but the name 'road' ought not to be disgraced in any such fashion. How
      much of it is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sax mal'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six miles! All like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw-w-w some pretty well, some as much bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know just what you mean,&rdquo; muttered Jerrard, &ldquo;but I fear I
      can imagine.&rdquo; After what seemed a long interval, and when Jerrard, dizzied
      by the bumps and the curves, believed that the end must be near,&mdash;for
      six miles are but an inconsiderable item to the traffic-manager of a
      thousand-mile system,&mdash;he asked how far they had come. The driver
      looked at the trees. &ldquo;Wan mal', mabbee, an' some leetle more.&rdquo; The
      railroad man opened his mouth to make a discourteous retort reflecting on
      the driver's judgment of distances, but just then one of the rear wheels
      slipped off a rock. It came down kerchunk. Jerrard bit his cheek and his
      tongue. After that he sat and held to his seat with a hopeless idea that
      the end of the road was running away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way through the woods he bought two fat doughnuts and a piece of
      apple pie at a wayside log house. He munched his humble fare with a gusto
      he had not known for years. The jolting, the shaking, the tossing had
      started his sluggish blood and cleared his business-befogged brain. His
      food was spiced with the aroma of the hemlocks, and when they took to the
      road again he began to hum tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/050.jpg" alt="Then he Fell to Chuckling 049-050 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Then he fell to chuckling. And when a smooth stretch suffered him to
      unclasp his cramped hold, he slapped his leg mirthfully. He was thinking
      what President Whittaker of the P. K. &amp; R. would be saying in two
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Whittaker was a rotund, flabby man, whom long indulgence in
      rubber-tired broughams and double-springed private cars had softened until
      he reminded one of a fat down pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerrard,&rdquo; he had said, at parting, &ldquo;if you find good fishing I'll follow
      you in two weeks. I need a little outdoor relaxation myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerrard sent an enthusiastic letter right back by the tote-road driver. He
      took the word of his guide about the fishing in prospect. In his new and
      ebullient spirits he felt that he could hardly wait two weeks for the
      spectacle&mdash;Whittaker in the middle seat of a buck-board, on that
      six-mile carry road. And when the day came, Jerrard, now bronzed, alert
      and agile walked out over the Poquette Carry, paddled down to Sunkhaze,
      and received his superior with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unconsciousness of the corpulent Whittaker as he left the train, spick
      and span in tweed and polished shoes appealed to Jerrard's sense of the
      ludicrous so acutely that the president, following the baggage-laden guide
      down to the shore of the lake, stopped and looked at his friend with
      puzzled gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jerrard, you seem to be in a good humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like the ozone of the forest to make you sparkle,&rdquo; chuckled the
      traffic-manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to describe the incidents of the trip across the lake,
      the apprehensive flinching of the fat president whenever the canoe
      lurched, and his fear of breaking through the bottom of the frail shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they were well out on the carry road in the buckboard, Jerrard,
      gazing on the indescribable mixture of reproach, horror, pain and
      astonishment that the president's face presented laughed until Whittaker
      forgot dignity, cares and fears, and laughed, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, as they were eating their lunch beside the famous spring
      in the north cove of Kennemagon Whittaker stretched himself luxuriously on
      the gray moss, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerrard, it's an earthly paradise! I never had such fishing, never saw
      such scenery. I want to come here every summer. I'd like to buy a tract
      here. But that six-mile drive&mdash;O dear me! It makes me shiver when I
      think I've got to bump back over it in two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening one Rowe, a timber-land exploring prospector, whose
      employment was locating tracts for the cutting of pulp stuff, stopped at
      the camp and accepted hospitality for the night. After supper the three
      lay in their bunks and chatted, while the guide pottered about the
      household tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much travel over the Poquette Carry?&rdquo; asked Whittaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good deal,&rdquo; said Rowe. &ldquo;It's the thoroughfare between the West Branch and
      Spinnaker, you know. All the men for the woods leave the train at
      Sunkhaze, boat it across Spinnaker, and walk the carry at Poquette. All
      the supplies for the camp come that way, too. They bateau goods up the
      river from the West Branch end of the carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't some one fix that road?&rdquo; asked the president. &ldquo;Looks to me as
      if they had brought rocks and thrown them into the trail just to make it
      worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all wild lands hereabouts,&rdquo; explained the prospector. &ldquo;The county
      commissioners lay out the roads and the landowners are supposed to build
      them, but they don't. Timber-land owners don't like roads through their
      woods, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see they don't,&rdquo; replied Whittaker dryly. &ldquo;What did you pay, Jerrard,
      for having your canoe and truck carried across?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen dollars for the duffel, and four dollars each for the guide,
      myself and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that for a tariff?&rdquo; laughed the president. Then he took out his
      pencil and book and put a series of interrogations to Rowe. At the close
      he pondered a while, and said to Jerrard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to our friend here, at least five thousand men cross that carry
      each year, making ten thousand through fares one way. Supplies&mdash;pressed
      hay, grain, foodstuffs and all that sort of freight&mdash;from ten to
      fifteen thousand tons. Then there's the sportsman traffic, which could be
      built up indefinitely if there were suitable transportation conveniences
      here. Say, Jerrard, do you know there's a fine place for a six-mile
      narrow-gage railroad right there on Poquette Carry? You and I didn't come
      down here looking up railroad possibilities, but really this thing strikes
      me favorably. Slow time and not very expensive equipment, but think what a
      convenience! It will also give you and me an excuse to come down here
      summers, eh?&rdquo; he added, humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll establish a colony here on Kennemagon,&rdquo; suggested Jerrard, half in
      jest, &ldquo;and start a land boom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; went on Whittaker &ldquo;the more I talk about that little road the
      more I am convinced it would pay a very good dividend. You and I can swing
      it. We can use some P. K. &amp; R. rails, fix up one of those narrow-gage
      shifters they used on the grain spur, and have a railroad while you wait.
      If we only clear enough to pay our own passage twice a year we'll be doing
      fairly well. And I'll be willing to pass dividends for the sake of riding
      from Spinnaker to the West Branch on a car-seat instead of a buckboard.
      Say, Rowe,&rdquo; he went on, jocosely, &ldquo;I suppose they'll have a mass-meeting
      and pass votes of thanks to Jerrard and myself if we put that project
      through, won't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowe squinted his eye along the sliver he was whittling. &ldquo;I don't know of
      any one specially that's hankering for railroad-lines round here,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to tell me that abomination of stones and muck-holes suits
      the public, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the folks I work for don't want to have it a mite smoother than it
      is. They're the public that's running this part of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a brand-new thing in transportation ideas, Jerrard!&rdquo; cried the
      president of the P. K. &amp;R.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing strange about our side of it,&rdquo; said the prospector. &ldquo;The people I
      work for own more than a million acres of timber land for feeding their
      pulp-mills, and the more city sports there are hanging round on the tracts
      and building fires, the more danger of a big blaze catching somewhere. And
      railroads bring sports. You don't hear of any lumbermen grumbling about
      the Poquette carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say, then, this section should have a little enterprise shaken
      into it,&rdquo; said Whittaker, tartly. This promised opposition promptly fired
      his modern spirit of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he and his manager had returned to their duties in the city, the
      surprising word began to go about the district that next year there would
      be a railroad across Poquette carry. When the rumor was traced to Rowe, he
      found himself in for a good deal of rough badinage for allowing two city
      sportsmen to &ldquo;guy&rdquo; him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster at Sunkhaze was a subscriber to a daily paper, every word
      of which he read. One day, among the inconspicuous notices of &ldquo;New
      Corporations,&rdquo; he found this paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poquette Carry Railway Company, organized for the purpose of constructing
      and operating a line of railroad between Spinnaker Lake and West Branch
      River. President, G. Howard Whittaker; vice-president and general manager,
      George P. Jerrard; secretary and treasurer, A. L. Bevan. Capital stock
      $100,000; $5,000 paid in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the postmaster had read that twice, he strode out of his little pen.
      Men in larrigans and leggings were huddled round the stove, for the autumn
      crispness comes early in the mountains. The postmaster's eye singled out
      Seth Bowers, the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Seth,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;wa'n't your sports last summer named Whittaker
      and Jerrard&mdash;the men ye had in on the Kennemagon waters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you boys listen to this,&rdquo; and the postmaster read the item with
      unction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks 's if they were going ahead, and as if there wasn't so much wind to
      it, after all,&rdquo; observed one of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Poquette Carry road hasn't been touched by shovel or pick for more
      than three years, and I don't believe that Col. Gid Ward and his crowd
      ever intend to hire another day's work on it. Colonel Gid says every
      operator and sport from Clew to Erie goes across there, and if there's any
      ro'd-repairin' all hands ought to turn to an' help on the expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This new railroad idea ought to hit him all right, then,&rdquo; remarked Seth,
      the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the postmaster, &ldquo;I'd just like to be round&mdash;far
      enough off so's the chips and splinters wouldn't hit me&mdash;when some
      one steps up and tells Col. Gid Ward that a concern of city men is going
      to put a railroad in across his land&mdash;that's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gid Ward has always backed everybody off the trail into the bushes round
      here&rdquo; said Seth. &ldquo;But he's up against a different crowd now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye think, in the first place, that Colonel Gid is going to sell 'em
      any right o' way across Poquette?&rdquo; asked the postmaster. &ldquo;He owns the
      whole tract there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's ways of getting it,&rdquo; replied Seth. &ldquo;Let lawyers alone for
      that when they're paid. If Gid don't sell, they can condemn and take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a week a portion of Seth's prediction concerning lawyers was verified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bevan, tall and thin and sallow, stepped off the train at Sunkhaze. He
      was a prominent attorney in one of the principal cities of the state, and
      served as clerk of this new corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard that Col. Gideon Ward was fifty miles up the West Branch,
      looking after a timber operation on Number 8, Range 23, he borrowed
      leggings, shoe-pacs and an overcoat and hastened on by means of a
      tote-team.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, silent and grim and pinched with cold, he unrolled himself
      from buffalo-robes and took the train at Sunkhaze. The postmaster and
      station-agent gave him several opportunities to relate the outcome of his
      negotiations, but the attorney was taciturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first news came down two week later by Miles McCormick, a swamper on
      Ward's Number 8 operation. The man had a gash on his cheek and a big
      purple swelling under one eye. When a man of Ward's crew came down from
      the woods marked in that manner, it was not necessary for him to say that
      he had been discharged by the choleric tyrant who ruled the forest forces
      from Chamberlain to Seguntiway. The only inquiry was as to method and
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes along to me as I was choppin',&rdquo; related Miles to the Sunkhaze
      postmaster, &ldquo;and he yowls, 'Git to goin' there, man, git to goin'!' 'An','
      says I, 'sure, an' I'll not yank the ax back till it's done cuttin'.' An'
      then he&rdquo; Miles put his finger carefully against the puffiness under his
      eye, &ldquo;he hit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a tall stranger come up on the tote-team two weeks or so ago?&rdquo;
       asked the postmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were,&rdquo; Miles replied, listlessly, and intent on his own troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear anything special about his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The old man took the stranger into the wangun camp, where it was
      private, and they talked. None of us heard 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the stranger went away, hey?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, well, at last we heard the
      old man howlin' and yowlin' in the wangun camp and then he comes a-pushing
      the tall stranger out with such awful language as you know he can. An' he
      says to the stranger, 'Talk about charters and condemning land till ye're
      black in the face, I say ye can't do it; and every rail ye lay I'll tie it
      into a bow-knot. An' I'll eat your charter, seals and all. An' I'll throw
      your engine into the lake. An' how do ye like the smell of those?' When he
      said it he cracked his old fists under the stranger's nose. An' the
      stranger gets into the team and goes away. So that's all of it, and none
      of us knowed what it meant at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster darted significant glances round the circle of faces at the
      stove, and the loungers returned the stare with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell ye?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as any one might ha' told that lawyer,&rdquo; said a man, clicking his
      knife-blade.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THREE&mdash;ENGINEER PARKER GETS FINAL ORDERS FOR &ldquo;THE LAND OF THE
      GIDEONITES.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The long autumn passed and winter set in. Snow fell on the carry and the
      big sleds jangled across. Men went up past Sunkhaze settlement into the
      great region of snow and silence, and men came down&mdash;bearded men,
      with hands calloused by the ax and the cross-cut saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Col. Gideon Ward's well known figure was not among the passengers on
      the tote-road. The upgoing men were bound for his camps, and were
      inquiring as to his whereabouts; the downgoing men stated that he was
      roaring from one log-landing to another, driving men and horses to make a
      record-breaking season, and so busy that he would not stop long enough to
      eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the discussion of the traits and deeds of this woods ogre, the
      stranger might readily believe him as terrifying as the celebrated &ldquo;Injun
      devil&rdquo;&mdash;and as much a creature of fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But each of the messengers that Ward sent down to the outer world bore
      unmistakable sign that this ruler of the wilderness was in full possession
      of his autocracy. This talisman was one of the most picturesque features
      of Ward's reign over the &ldquo;Gideonites,&rdquo; as his men were called all through
      the great north country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never intrusted money to woodsmen, for he deemed them irresponsible; he
      found that writings and orders were too easily mislaid. Therefore,
      whenever he sent a messenger to town or a man down the line with a
      tote-team for goods, he scrawled on his back with a piece of chalk the
      peculiar hieroglyph of crosses and circles that made up the Gideon Ward
      &ldquo;log-mark.&rdquo; This mark was good for lodging and meals at any tavern, was
      authority for the transfer of goods, and procured transportation for the
      man whose back was thus inscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Colonel Ward sent a crew of men into the woods he marked the back of
      each one in this fashion, as if the employees were freight parcels. The
      exhibition of that chalk-mark and the words &ldquo;Charge to Ward&rdquo; were enough.
      And such was the fear of all men that the chalk-mark was never abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, on each grand spring settling day most of the dollars that
      circulated in the region came through the hands of Col. Ward. This fact
      naturally increased the deference paid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A railroad?&rdquo; sneered one man, just down from Number 4 camp. &ldquo;A railroad
      across Poquette? Across Gid Ward's land, spouting sparks and settin' fires
      and hustlin' in sports? Well, you don't see any railroad-buildin' goin'
      on, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was certainly but one reply to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ye won't see any, either. Gid Ward just bellowed once at that lawyer,
      and he ran away, ki-yi! ki-yi! You'll never hear any more railroad talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He expressed the public opinion, for even Seth, the guide, regretfully
      came to the conclusion that the tyrant of the West Branch had &ldquo;backed
      down&rdquo; the city men by his belligerent reception of their emissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon after the first of January the postmaster's daily paper brought
      some further news. The state legislature had assembled in biennial session
      that winter. In the course of its reports the newspaper stated that the
      &ldquo;Po-quette Carry Railway Company,&rdquo; a corporation organized under the
      general law, had brought before the railroad commissioners a petition for
      their approval of the project, and that a day was appointed for a hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The city men had the sand, after all,&rdquo; was his admiring comment. &ldquo;They
      don't propose to start firing till they get all their legal ammunition
      ready, and that's why they've been waitin'. We're goin' to see warm times
      on the Spinnaker waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For that matter the daily newspaper brought to snow-heaped Sunkhaze
      intelligence of &ldquo;warm times&rdquo; at the hearing. The legal counsel and
      lobbyists who represented the puissant timber interests of the state
      protested against allowing this railroad corporation to acquire any rights
      across the wild lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pointed out that a dangerous precedent would be established; that
      forest fires would be sure to originate from the locomotive's sparks, and
      that the Poquette woods were the center of the great West Branch timber
      growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel for the incorporators said that his clients realized this
      danger, and anticipated that this objection, a potent one, would be made.
      They were willing to show their liberal intent by binding themselves to
      run their trains only in rainy or &ldquo;lowery&rdquo; weather, or when the ground was
      damp. In times of dangerous drought they would suspend operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rainy-Day Railroad,&rdquo; as it was nicknamed immediately, excited
      considerable hilarity at the state-house and in the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was fought out with much animation. The counsel for the railway
      made much of the fact that these timber owners had fought the very
      reasonable state tax that had been imposed on their vast and valuable
      holdings. He drew attention to the needs of the sportsman class, that was
      spending much money in the state each year, and declared that unless they
      were treated with some courtesy and generosity, they would go into New
      Brunswick.
    </p>
    <p>
      But those deepest in the secrets of the very vigorous legislative fray
      knew that the timber-land owners feared more results than they advanced in
      their arguments against the charter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years there had been rumors that extensive capital was ready to
      tap a certain big railway and afford a shorter cut to the sea. Such a
      cut-off would mean opening great tracts of woodland to the steam horse&mdash;and
      where the steam horse goes there go settlers. The timberland owners had
      found that settlers do not wait for clear titles, but squat and burn and
      plant until evicted, and eviction by course of law means expense and
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, the Poquette Carry line appeared on the surface to be so
      innocent that to allege against it the great whispered scheme seemed
      ridiculous. Therefore the counsel of the timber barons did not bring out
      in the committee-room hearings all they suspected, for fear that they
      would be laughed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Poquette Carry Road got what it asked for at last, the opposition
      daring to put forward only its slight pretexts. But the timber interests
      retired growling bitterly, and angrily apprehensive. They could not
      understand that big men are sometimes actuated by whims. Here they saw the
      controllers of the great P. K. &amp; R. system behind this insignificant
      project in the north woods. They gave these shrewd railroad men no credit
      for ingenuousness. And the resolve that was thereupon made at secret
      conclave of the timber men to fight that first encroachment on their
      old-time domains and rights was a stern and a bitter resolve. The
      knowledge of it would have mightily astonished&mdash;might have daunted
      effectually a certain young engineer who was just then learning from
      Manager Jerrard the details of his new commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, late in March, Whittaker and Jerrard found themselves with a
      charter and a location approved by the state railroad commissioners,
      permitting them to build a six-mile railroad across Poquette Carry; to
      carry passengers, baggage, express and freight, but with the limitation
      that when the state land-agent should think the condition of drought
      dangerous and should so notify the company, the road should cease to run
      any trains until rain wet down the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The location was taken by right of eminent domain, and all the provisions
      of the law were complied with. No settlement for the damage caused to
      Colonel Ward through the loss of his land was possible, altho the railroad
      company made liberal offers, and he was finally left to pursue his remedy
      in the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time Jerrard had kept his negotiations with young Parker a
      private matter between the two of them, even as he had kept some of the
      annoying legislative details away from his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What engineer can you send down there and handle the thing for us?&rdquo; asked
      President Whittaker, when Jerrard informed him that all the legal details
      had been settled. &ldquo;I want some one who knows enough to get the line going
      in season for our August trip&mdash;and above all to keep still. I don't
      want to hear a word about it till I get out of a canoe at Poquette Carry
      next summer. Here we want to build a wheelbarrow road, and I have been
      having hard work to convince some of our bankers that I'm not planning a
      coup against the Canadian Pacific. Bosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These timber-land owners started most of that foolishness,&rdquo; said Jerrard.
      &ldquo;But speaking of a man, there's Rodney Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been with the engineers two years on the Falls cut-off's new work. I
      can't think of any one else who will suit us as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tisn't going to take any very wonderful man to build this road,&rdquo; the
      president snapped, rather impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile crept into the wrinkles about Jerrard's shrewd eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whittaker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there's a side to our railroad enterprise that
      neither you nor I appreciated at first. I've been getting some points from
      our counsel, who had a talk with Bevan. When we were up at the lake, you
      remember something that Rotre said about the timber-land owners not
      especially hankering for a railroad at the carry. Well, Bevan says the
      land there is owned by a man named Ward&mdash;Col, Gideon Ward, one of the
      big lumber operators of that section. From Bevan's account, Ward must be
      something like a cross between a bull moose and a Bengal tiger, Bevan went
      up to see him. He thought he could make a deal for the right of way, and
      thus would not be obliged to bother with condemnation proceedings and stir
      up talk and all that. Devan declares that getting a charter is one thing
      but the building of that road will be another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got the law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law gets very thin when you step over the line into an unorganized timber
      township. They tell me that old Ward comes pretty near making his own
      laws, and makes them with his fists or a club or else through his gang
      that they call 'The Gideonites' in that country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Parker, is he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got him out in my room. I've been talking with him. Better have him
      step in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president pushed his desk button, and the messenger hastened on his
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; explained the traffic manager, &ldquo;doesn't look any more savage
      than a house cat. But he's the man who went down into the camp of those
      Italians at the Fall's cut-off when they were having their bread squabble,
      and he backed the whole gang into the camp and made them sit down at the
      table. Of course, we hope we shall need only an engineer and not a warrior
      at Poquette, and we trust that Ward will be tractable and all that; but,
      Whittaker, if we're going to build that road, and are not to be backed
      down in such a way that we'll never dare to show our faces before the
      grinning natives at Sunkhaze then we need to send along a chap like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker!&rdquo; opportunely announced the boy, at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker seemed tall and angular and rather awkward. The brown of
      out-of-doors was upon his skin. His eyelids dropped at the corners in
      rather a listless way, but the eyes beneath were gray and steady. He was
      young, not more than twenty-five, so Whittaker judged at his first sharp
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can build that road that Jerrard has been telling you
      about?&rdquo; asked the president, briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, sir.&rdquo; Parker spoke with a drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand what the plan is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jerrard has explained quite fully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of bears and owls?&rdquo; The president spoke jocosely, but
      there was a significant tone in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I should spend much time climbing trees,&rdquo; replied Parker,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand that the man we send must take the whole undertaking on
      his own shoulders? Neither Mr. Jerrard nor myself cares to think about the
      matter, even.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'll be glad to be instructed, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;You'll have
      instructions as to limit of construction cost per mile, authority to draw
      on us as you need money, and the road must be in operation by the middle
      of July. Now Jerrard speaks well of your qualifications. What do you
      think?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am ready to accept the commission, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;You'll have to get
      away at once, Parker,&rdquo; said Jerrard. &ldquo;You must get construction material
      and supplies across Spinnaker before the ice breaks up. You can depend on
      the most of April for ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can start when you say the word.&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall rush material. Suppose you
      start to-morrow morning?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'll start sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room when he was informed that his instructions would await
      him that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerrard,&rdquo; said the president, gazing after the young man, &ldquo;your friend
      isn't an especially <i>pretty</i> frog but I'll bet he can jump more than
      once his length.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOUR&mdash;IN WHICH THE DOUGHTY &ldquo;SWAMP SWOGON&rdquo; ASTONISHES SUNKHAZE
      SETTLEMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days afterward Parker ate his supper at the Sunkhaze tavern and spent
      the evening going over the schedule of material that was following him by
      freight, its progress over connecting lines hastened by all the &ldquo;pull&rdquo;
       inspired by the P. K. &amp; R.'s bills of lading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, even while the frosty sun was red behind the spruces, he
      had arranged with the station agent for side-track privileges, and then
      questioned that functionary regarding local conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need twenty or more four-horse teams,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;What's the best
      way to advertise here?&rdquo; &ldquo;I reckon you can advertise and advertise,&rdquo;
       replied the station agent, &ldquo;but that's all the good it'll do you. Colonel
      Gid Ward has about every spare team in this county yardin' logs for him
      this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-five a month for a span o' hosses, and hosses and man kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll pay forty-five and feed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't want to be the man that went up on Gid Ward's operations and
      tried to hire his teams away!&rdquo; growled the agent. &ldquo;You can't hire any one
      round here for an errand of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd go myself if I thought I could get the horses,&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd advise you to save yourself a fifty-mile ride up the tote-road,&rdquo; the
      agent counseled. &ldquo;Even if Ward didn't catch you, you'd find that no man
      would da'st to leave there. Furthermore, you've only got a little, short
      job here, scarcely worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The logic of the reply impressed Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not spare the time anyway, to travel far up into the woods in
      quest of horses. His material must be conveyed across Spinnaker Lake in
      some other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it up the lake to Poquette?&rdquo; he asked the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Parker, after a tour of inspection, had settled his problem
      of transportation in his own mind. His plan was ingenious.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were half a dozen men available in Sunkhaze, and more were arriving
      daily, straggling down from the woods or roaring in fresh from the city,
      hurrying on the way up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster owned a hardwood tract, and Parker set his little crew at
      work chopping birch saplings and fashioning from them huge sleds, strongly
      bolted. As for himself, he entered into a contract with the local
      blacksmith, threw his coat off and went to work on some contrivances,
      round which the settlement's loungers congregated from dawn till dark the
      next day, watching the progress and wondering audibly &ldquo;what such a blamed
      contraption was goin' to turn out to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker kept his own counsel. At the end of two days, with the assistance
      of the blacksmith, he had remodeled four ox-cart tires. Each tire was
      spurred with bristling steel spikes, bolted firmly. In reply to his
      telegram, &ldquo;Rush loco, all equipments and coal,&rdquo; the little narrow-gage
      engine arrived, at the tail of the procession of flat cars, loaded with
      materials of construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Parker's crew had been increased to a score of laborers, and
      he had picked up three yokes of oxen and four horses from the few pioneer
      farmers who lived near Sunkhaze. With tackle and derrick the locomotive
      was swung upon a specially constructed sled, and the spurred tires were
      set upon its drivers. Then the great idea locked in Parker's head became
      apparent to the population of Sunkhaze.
    </p>

       alt="Then the Great Idea -- Frontispiece " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorry!&rdquo; said the postmaster. &ldquo;If that young feller hain't got a horse
      there that'll beat anything that even Colonel Gid Ward himself ever sent
      across Spinnaker Lake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid the utmost excitement of the spectators, the &ldquo;engine on runners&rdquo; was
      &ldquo;snubbed&rdquo; down the steep hill and eased out upon the road leading to the
      lake. Two hours' work with levers and wedges had adjusted the machine
      until the spurred wheels had the requisite &ldquo;bite&rdquo; upon the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dark on the day of the &ldquo;launching&rdquo; Parker gazed off across the level of
      the lake, and said to his men:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, boys, the Spinnaker Lake Air-Line Railroad will run its first
      train to Po-quette Carry. No freight this time. I want to lay out my
      landing up there. So all aboard at nine o'clock. Three cars,&rdquo; he said,
      pointing to the new sleds, &ldquo;and a free ride for all of you, with my
      compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An honest cheer greeted his jocular announcement, and that evening all the
      Sunk-haze male population assembled round the stove in the post-office to
      discuss the matter. When the evening was yet young, a red-faced,
      red-whiskered man, snow-shoes on his back and fresh from the up-country
      trail, came and warmed himself, listening with interest to the lively
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's what that thing is down on the lake?&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;'Twas
      dark when I came by, and I swan if it didn't scare me. Want to know if
      that's the engine we've been hearin' about up our way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where ye from, stranger?&rdquo; asked one of the loungers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 7 cuttin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one of Gid Ward's men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, has Ward heard about the railroad preparations?&rdquo; inquired the
      postmaster. This query had been propounded with eagerness to every new
      arrival from the woods for the past three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the men quickened, and they crowded round the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hain't said anything special yet, so I heard,&rdquo; replied the man.
      &ldquo;Hain't done anything but swear so far, so they tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he&mdash;has he started to come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feller from up the line telephoned across the carry that a streak of fur,
      bells and brimstone went past his place, and so I should judge that
      Colonel Gid is on the way down,&rdquo; drawled the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he'll come across that lake in the morning,&rdquo; said the postmaster,
      jabbing his thumb over his shoulder, &ldquo;scorchin' the snow and leavin' a hot
      hole in the air behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Parker came in to post his letters. The crowd gazed on
      him with new interest and with a certain significance in their glances
      that caught his eyes. The postmaster noticed his mute inquiry, and
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News from the interior, Mr. Parker, is that you prob'ly won't have any
      ice in Spinnaker to-morrow to run your engine on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded the young man, with some surprise. The postmaster's sober
      face hid his jest. Parker surveyed wonderingly the grins curling under the
      listeners' beards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Colonel Gid Ward is comin' across in the mornin' and it's reckoned
      he'll burn up the ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cackle of laughter came from the assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's plenty of room on Spinnaker for both of us, I think,&rdquo; Parker
      replied, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better hitch your engine,&rdquo; suggested one of the group. &ldquo;She's li'ble to
      take to the woods and climb a tree when she hears old Gid. And you can
      hear him a good way off, now I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster knuckled his chin humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you'll hear him 'bout the same time you see him. Five years ago he
      was arrested down to the village for drivin' through the streets
      lickety-whelt without bells. Run over two or three people, first and last.
      Gid said he'd give 'em bells enough, if that's what they wanted. He began
      collecting bells all the way from a cow-bell down. At last accounts he had
      about two hundred on his hoss and sleigh, and was still addin'. Now he
      makes every hoss on the street run away. The men wish they'd let him alone
      in the first place. He'll prob'ly want your engine-bell when he sees it
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another cackle from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker left without answering, and went to his dingy little room in the
      tavern. He did not doubt that the timber-land owners, beaten in their
      earlier and formal opposition, were inciting the irascible old colonel to
      pit might against right. The young man went over his papers once more,
      carefully and methodically posted himself as to his rights and powers, and
      then slept with the calmness of one who knows his course and is prepared
      to follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning all the male population of Sunkhaze settlement surveyed
      with rapt interest the preliminaries of getting up steam under the &ldquo;Swamp
      Swogon,&rdquo; as one of the guides had humorously nicknamed the little
      locomotive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a bystander leveled his mittened hand above his eyes and gazed up
      the long trail across the lake. The road was &ldquo;brushed out&rdquo; by little
      bushes set along at regular intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away off on the distant perspective a dot was advancing. It resolved
      itself into horse and sleigh. Puffs of vapor from the steaming animal
      indicated the urgent precipitancy of its speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that'll be Colonel Gideon Ward!&rdquo; called the man who had just
      observed the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker, busy with his gages and oil-can, gave one look up the road and
      went on with his labors. In a few moments the jangling beat of many bells
      throbbed on the frosty air. As if answering a challenge, the locomotive's
      escape valve shot up its hissing volume of steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very nearly ready, gentlemen!&rdquo; called Parker. He gave an order to
      his volunteer fireman, and suggested that intending passengers get aboard
      the sleds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sound the whistle,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There may be some still waiting up at
      the store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whistle shrieks were many and prolonged. The horse, speeding down the
      lake, was only a few rods away. He stopped, crouched, and dodged sidewise
      in terror. An old man stood up and began to belabor the frightened animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a queer figure, that old man, in the high-backed, high-fender
      sleigh. On his head was a tall peaked fur cap, with a barred coon tail
      flopping at its apex. A big fur coat, also covered with coon tails, made
      the man's figure almost Brobdingnagian in circumference. It was Colonel
      Gideon Ward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIVE&mdash;HOW COLONEL GIDEON WAS BACKED DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME
      IN HIS LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Above the purple knobs on his cheekbones Colonel Gideon Ward's little gray
      eyes snapped malevolently. He roared as he lashed at his trembling horse.
      The animal dodged and backed and stubbornly refused to advance on the
      strange thing that was pouring white clouds into the air and uttering
      fearful cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the horse reared, stood upright and fell upon its side,
      splintering the thills. Several of the men ran forward, but before the
      animal could scramble to its feet Ward leaped out, tied its forelegs
      together with the reins, and left it floundering in the snow. Then he came
      forward with his great whip in his hand. The crowd drew aside
      apprehensively, and he tramped straight up to the locomotive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do ye mean,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;by having engines out here to scare hosses
      into conniptions? Take that thing off this lake and put it back on the
      railroad tracks up there where it belongs!&rdquo; He shook his fists over his
      shoulder in the direction of the distant embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; said Parker, blandly, &ldquo;that there is some twenty
      inches difference between the gage of the wheels and the gage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care that&rdquo;&mdash;and Colonel Ward snapped the great whip&mdash;&ldquo;for
      your gages and your gouges! Take that engine off this ro'd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care to discuss the matter,&rdquo; returned Parker, quietly. &ldquo;I am busy
      about my own affairs&mdash;too busy to quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use of me and you backin' and fillin'!&rdquo; shouted the old man.
      &ldquo;You know me and I know you. You think you're goin' to tote your material
      up over this lake and build that railroad across my carry at Poquette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's what I am going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ward shot out his two great fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, ye ain't!&rdquo; he howled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker turned and consulted his steam-gage and water indicator. Then he
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;First train for Poquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A nervous little laugh went round at his quiet jest, and twoscore men
      boarded the sleds. For the first time in his roaring, reckless and
      quarrelsome life Colonel Gideon Ward found himself in the presence of a
      man who defied him scornfully and facing an obstacle that promised
      ridiculous defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The titter of the crowd spurred his rage into fury. He took his whip
      between his teeth, and grasping the hand-rods, was about to lift himself
      into the cab. Parker put his gloved hand against the old man's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without an invitation, Colonel Ward,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our party is made
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want to ride in your infernal engine!&rdquo; bellowed Ward, &ldquo;I'm goin' to
      hoss-whip you, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ward, you know the legal status of the Poquette Carry Railroad,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't know it, then consult your counsel. You are on the property
      of the Poquette Railroad Company. I order you off. There's nothing for you
      to do but to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eyes as fiery as Ward's own met the colonel. The pressure on his breast
      straightened to a push. He fell back upon the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Parker pulled the throttle. The spike-spurred
      driving-wheels whirred and slashed the ice and snow until the &ldquo;bite&rdquo;
       started the train, and then it moved away up the long road, leaving Ward
      screaming maledictions after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; panted the fireman, &ldquo;that'll be the first time Colonel Gid Ward
      was ever stood round in his whole life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to have words with an old man,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;but he must
      accept the new conditions here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is new, all right!&rdquo; gasped the fireman, with an expressive sweep of
      his hand about the little cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker was watching his new contrivance with interest. His steering-gear
      was rude, being a single runner under the tender with tiller attachment,
      but it served the purpose. The road was so nearly a straight line that
      little steering was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow on the lake road was solid, and the spikes, with the weight of
      the engine settling them, drove the sleds along at a moderate rate of
      speed. The problem of the lake transportation was settled. When Parker
      quickened the pace to something like twelve miles an hour, the men cheered
      him hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip to Poquette was exhilarating and uneventful. Parker left his
      fireman to look after the &ldquo;train,&rdquo; and accompanied by an interested
      retinue of citizens, tramped across the six miles of carry road on a
      preliminary tour of inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route was fairly level; a few détours would save all cuts, and the
      plan of trestles would do away with fills. With the eye of the practised
      engineer, Parker saw that neither survey nor construction involved any
      special problems. Therefore he selected his landing on the Spinnaker
      shore, and resolved to make all haste in hauling his material across the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the expedition arrived at Sunkhaze at dusk, the postmaster brought
      the information that Colonel Ward had stormed away on the down-train with
      certain hints about getting some law on his own account. He had sworn over
      and over in most ferocious fashion that the Poquette Carry road should not
      be built so long as law and dynamite could be bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days Parker peacefully transported material, twenty tons a trip
      and two trips a day. On the evening of the third day Colonel Ward arrived
      from the city, accompanied by a sharp-looking lawyer. The two immediately
      hastened away across the lake toward Poquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker had twenty men garrisoned in a log camp at the carry, and had
      little fear that his supplies would be molested. It was hardly credible,
      either, that a man with as extensive property interests as Colonel Ward
      possessed would dare to destroy wantonly the goods of a railroad company
      in the strong position of the Poquette road. However, Parker resolved to
      make a survey at once, in order to put the swampers at work chopping trees
      and clearing the right of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the cab of his engine the next forenoon at Poquette, he saw
      the furred figure of Colonel Ward in front of his carry camp a sort of
      half-way station for the timber operator's itinerant crews. The lawyer was
      at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker ignored their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later the young engineer had established his Spinnaker
      terminal point, and was running his lines. Still no word from the colonel,
      who was tramping up and down in front of the camp. Parker's whimsical
      fancy pictured those furs and coon tails as bristling and fluffing like
      the hair of an angry cat.
    </p>

       alt="Appearance of an Enraged Polar Bear 078-100 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The young man wondered what card his antagonists were preparing to play.
      He found out promptly when he ordered his swampers to advance with their
      axes and begin chopping down the trees on the right of way. At the first
      &ldquo;chock&rdquo; ringing out on the crisp silence of the woods Ward came running
      down the snowy stretch of tote-road, presenting much the same appearance
      as would an up reared and enraged polar bear. The lawyer hurried after
      him, and several woodsmen followed more leisurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another chip from those trees! Not another chip!&rdquo; bawled the colonel.
      The men stopped chopping and looked at each other doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've been told to go ahead here,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what yeh've been told. You all know me, don't you?&rdquo; Ward
      slapped his breast. &ldquo;You know me? Well, I say stop that chopping on my&mdash;understand?&mdash;on
      <i>my</i> land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker, who was in advance of the choppers with his instruments, heard,
      and came plowing through the snow. He found Colonel Ward roaring oaths and
      abuse, brandishing his fists, and backing the crew of a dozen men fairly
      off the right of way. Ward's own band of &ldquo;Gideonites&rdquo; stood at a little
      distance, grinning admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker set himself squarely in front of the old man, elbowing aside a
      woodsman to whom the colonel was addressing himself. The young engineer's
      gaze was level and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are interfering with my men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was a wordless snarl of ire and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no mistaking your disposition,&rdquo; continued Parker. &ldquo;You have set
      yourself to balk this enterprise. But I haven't any time to spend in a
      quarrel with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get off my land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, Colonel Ward, you know as well as I that my principals
      have complied with all the provisions of law in taking this location. This
      road is going through. I am going to put it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk back to me, will you? Talk to me! ni&mdash;I'll&mdash;&rdquo; Ward's rage
      choked his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I'll talk to you, sir, and I am perfectly qualified to boss my
      men. Go ahead there, boys!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; broke in the suave voice of the lawyer. &ldquo;I see you
      don't understand the entire situation. Briefly, then, Mr. Ward has a
      telephone-line across this carry. You may see the wires from where you
      stand. I find that your right of way trespasses on Colonel Ward's
      telephone location. In this confusion of locations, you will see the
      advisability of suspending operations until the matter can be referred to
      the courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is room for Colonel Ward's telephone and for our railroad, too,&rdquo; he
      retorted. &ldquo;If we are compelled to remove any poles, we'll replace them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Parker did not know that the telephone-line was, in fact, only
      Colonel Ward's private line, and after the taking by the railroad was on
      the location wholly without right. But that was a matter for his
      superiors, and not for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another point that I fear you have not noted. Colonel Ward's telephone
      wires are affixed to trees, and your men are preparing to cut down these
      same trees in clearing your right of way. You see it can't be done, Mr.
      Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an unmistakable sneer in the lawyer's tones. Parker's anger
      mounted to his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm no lawyer,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I have been assured by our counsel that I
      have the right to build a railroad here, and I reckon he knows! I've been
      told to build this railroad and, Mr. Attorney, I'm going to build it. I've
      been told to have it completed by a certain time, and I haven't days and
      weeks to spend splitting hairs in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I see you're not much of a lawyer!&rdquo; jeered the other. &ldquo;Mr. Parker,
      you may as well take your plaything,&rdquo; pointing to the engine, &ldquo;and trundle
      it along home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that!&rdquo; Parker snatched an ax from the nearest man. &ldquo;Mr.
      Lawyer, you may <i>go</i> back to the city and fight your legal points
      with the man my principals hire for that purpose, and enjoy yourself as
      much as you can. In the meantime I'll be building a railroad. Men, those
      trees are to come down at once.&rdquo; He began to hack at a tree with great
      vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choppers, encouraged by his firm attitude, promptly moved forward and
      began to use their axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The club you must use, Colonel, is an injunction,&rdquo; advised the
      crestfallen lawyer after he had watched operations a few moments. Ward was
      swearing violently. &ldquo;I'll have one here in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The irate lumberman whirled on his counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Your injunction would prob'ly be like the
      law you've handed out here to-day. You said you'd stop him, but you
      haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no law for a fool!&rdquo; snapped the attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along with your law!&rdquo; roared Ward. &ldquo;I was an idiot ever to fuss with
      it or depend on it. 'Tain't any good up here. 'Tain't the way for real men
      to fight. I've got somethin' better'n law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his fists at Parker. &ldquo;Better'n law!&rdquo; he repeated, in a shrill
      howl. &ldquo;Better'n law!&rdquo; he cried again. &ldquo;And you'll get it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first the engineer believed that Ward was about to rally his little
      band at the carry camp, but the old man turned and stumped away. His
      lawyer tried to interpose and address him, but the colonel angrily shoved
      him to one side with such force that the attorney tumbled backward into
      the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out my horse!&rdquo; the colonel screamed, as he advanced toward the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      A helper precipitately backed the turnout from the hovel. Ward leaped into
      the sleigh, pulled his peaked fur cap down over his ears, and took up the
      reins and big whip. He brandished his great fist at the little group he
      had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better'n law!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;That for your law!&rdquo; and he struck his
      rangy horse with a crack as loud as a pistol-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal leaped like a deer, fairly lifting the narrow sleigh, and with
      tails fluttering from his fur robes, his cap's coon tail streaming behind,
      away up the tote-road went Gideon Ward on his return to the deep woods,
      the mighty din of his myriad bells clashing down the forest aisles. At the
      distant turn of the road he hooted with the vigor of a screech owl,
      &ldquo;Better'n law!&rdquo; and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your client doesn't seem to be in an especially amiable and lamb-like
      mood this morning,&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer dusted the snow from his garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful disposition, old Gid Ward has!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Left me here to
      walk sixteen miles to a railroad-station, and never offered to settle with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the 'Poquette and Sunkhaze Air-Line,&rdquo; Parker smiled. &ldquo;You are
      free to ride back with us when we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hard feelings, then?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not small-minded, I trust,&rdquo; returned Parker. The lawyer looked at the
      self-possessed young man with pleased interest. This generous attitude
      appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize, young man,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;that old Gideon Ward never had
      a man really back him down before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know much about Colonel Ward personally, except that he has a
      very disagreeable disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made him just as near a maniac as a man can be and still go about
      his business. There'll be a lot of trouble come from this. Hadn't you
      better advise your folks to call it off? They haven't the least idea, I
      imagine, what a proposition you are up against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep on attending to my business,&rdquo; Parker replied. &ldquo;If any one
      interferes with that business, he'll do so at his own risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are depending too much on your legal rights and on the
      protection of the law. Now Gideon Ward has always made might right in this
      section. He is rough and ignorant, but the old scamp has a heap of money
      and a rich gang to back him. I tell you, there are a lot of things he can
      do to you, and then escape by using his money and his pull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I have seen of the old man's temper, I am prepared to put a
      pretty high estimate on his capacity for mischief; but on the other hand,
      Mr. Attorney, suppose I should go back to my people and say I allowed an
      old native up here in the woods to back me off our property? I fear my
      chances for promotion on the P. K, and R. system would get a blacker eye
      than I shall give him if he ever shakes his fist under my nose again. Have
      all the people up here allowed that old wretch to browbeat and tyrannize
      over them without a word of protest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has been whaled once or twice, but it never did him any good. For
      instance, a favorite trick of his is to make every one flounder out of a
      tote-road into the deep snow. He won't turn out an inch. Most of the men
      he meets are working for him or selling him goods, and they don't dare to
      complain. However, one teamster he crowded off in that way broke two
      ox-goads on the old man. But that whipping only set him against other
      travellers more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time Ward got what he deserved down at Sunkhaze. A man opened a
      store there and put in a plate-glass window, being anxious to show a bit
      of progress. There's nothing old Ward hates so much as he does what he
      calls 'slingin' on airs,' When he drove down from the woods and saw that
      new window he growled, 'Wal, it seems to me we're gettin' blamed
      high-toned all of a sudden!' He got out, rooted up a big rock and hove it
      right through the middle of that new pane of glass the only pane of plate
      glass Sunkhaze ever saw. Well, the storeman tore out and licked Ward till
      he cried. Storeman didn't know who the old man was till after it was all
      over. Neither did old Gid know how big that storeman was till he saw him
      coming out through that broken glass. Otherwise both might have thought
      twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ward boycotted and persecuted him till he had to sell out and leave town.
      He has persecuted everybody. His wife has been in the insane asylum going
      on ten years; his only girl ran away and got married to a cheap fellow,
      and his son is in state prison. The boy ran away from home, got into bad
      company, and shot a policeman who was trying to arrest him. If you are not
      crazy or dead before he gets done with you, then you'll come out luckier
      than I think you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this consoling remark the lawyer plodded up to the camp, to wait
      until it should be time to start down the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Parker toiled through the woods that day he reflected seriously on his
      situation. He fully appreciated the fact that Ward's malice intended some
      ugly retaliation. The danger viewed here in the woods and away from the
      usual protections of society seemed imminent and to be dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young man realized how skeptically Whittaker and Jerrard would
      view any such apprehensions as he might convey to them, reading his letter
      in the comfortable and matter-of-fact serenity of the city. He knew how
      impatient it made President Whittaker to be troubled with any
      subordinate's worry over details. His rule was to select the right man,
      say, &ldquo;Let it be done,&rdquo; and then, after the manner of the modern financial
      wizard inspect the finished result and bestow blame or praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker regretfully concluded that he must keep his own counsel until some
      act more overt and ominous forced him to share his responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as he sat in his room at the tavern, busy with his first
      figures of the survey, some one knocked and entered at his call, &ldquo;Come
      in!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SIX&mdash;IN WHICH &ldquo;THE CAT-HERMIT OF MOXIE&rdquo; CASTS HIS SHADOW LONG
      BEFORE HIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the postmaster who appeared at Parker's invitation to enter. That
      official stroked down his beard, tipped his chair back, surveyed the young
      man with the solemnity of the midnight raven and observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you and Colonel Gid had it hot and tight up to Poquette to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was an argument,&rdquo; returned Parker, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to be considered as meddlin' with your affairs, Mr. Parker,
      but I've known Gid Ward for a good many years, and I want to advise you to
      look sharp that he doesn't do you some pesky mean kind of harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been warned already, Mr. Dodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you don't seem to take it to heart enough. Or if you do, you
      don't show it. That was the reason I was afraid you didn't realize what a
      man you have to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me like a blustering coward. Your really brave and determined
      men don't make so much talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gid Ward has tried his usual game of scare with his mouth, and it
      didn't work. He won't come again at you that way in the open right way.
      But&rdquo;&mdash;the postmaster brought his chair down on its four legs and
      leaned forward to whisper&mdash;&ldquo;he'll come again at you in the dark, and
      it's then that he's dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I needn't tell you, Mr. Dodge, that I do not propose to be
      backed down and driven out of this section by a man like that. I dare say
      he is planning mischief, but I have my work to do here, and I shall keep
      on as best I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire your spunk, young man,&rdquo; said the postmaster, heartily, &ldquo;and I
      hope you'll come through this all right. But I have felt it my duty to see
      that you were warned good and solid. I know how Gid Ward got his start in
      life&mdash;and by as mean a trick as ever a man put up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His brother Joshua Ward, enlisted for the war in the sixties. Bachelor,
      Joshua was. He was going with one of the Marshall girls in Carmel, and the
      thing was settled final. Hows'ever, Josh went away to the war without
      getting married, because he allowed that if he got killed, an unmarried
      girl wouldn't have to take last pickings of the men, like a widow would.
      Mighty kind, square, good-hearted chap that Josh Ward now I can tell ye!
      Thought of others first all the time. He owned a mighty nice place that
      his aunt had willed to him. She liked Josh, but hated the sight of Gid,
      same's every one else did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Josh went away he deeded his farm and everything to that Marshall
      girl. Told her that if he came back they would get married, and it would
      be all right. If he didn't come back, he wanted her to marry a good man,
      and told her that the farm would make a home for them and help her to get
      the best kind of a husband. As I told you, that Joshua Ward was as good as
      wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a year that Marshall girl heard from Josh regularly, and then the
      papers reported that he was killed in a big battle, and from then to the
      end of the war&mdash;two years or more&mdash;there wasn't a word from him
      or of him. Meanwhile Gid laid his plan. The Marshall girl had an idea that
      if she married Gid&mdash;though he wasn't her style&mdash;it would please
      Josh, for then the place would stay in the family. She mourned for Josh
      terribly, but Gid was right after her all the time, and there she was with
      a farm on her hands, and so she finally up and married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Joshua Ward's case it happened, as it did in hundreds of other cases,
      where the poor chaps weren't important enough to be heard about or from.
      He was just captured instead of killed, and went from Libby to
      Andersonville, from Andersonville to Macon, and when Lee surrendered he
      came home, thin's a shadow, shaking with ague and with eyes bigger than
      burnt holes in a blanket. Pitiful figure he was, I tell you. I was running
      a livery business in Carmel village then, and Josh hired me to take him
      out to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I broke the thing to him on the way. Made my throat ache, now I tell you,
      Mr. Parker. Made my eyes smart and the fields and sky look blurry to see
      that poor wreck, with everything gone, and know that the hog that had
      stayed to home was enjoying it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what made me, as a man, despise Gid Ward more was the fact that he
      had been colonel of a state regiment in old militia days, boosted there by
      a gang that trained with him, and as soon as war broke out and the
      regiment was mustered in he resigned like a sneak, and couldn't be touched
      by a draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josh always was a quiet chap. He humped over a little more when I told
      him, and looked thinner, and I had to help him more when he got out at the
      farm than I did when he got aboard at the stable. He allowed he'd go to
      the farm just the same. Said he didn't have any money, or any other place
      to go, and he guessed 'twas his home, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker, I haven't got the language to tell ye how that woman looked
      when she came to the door and saw me helping Josh out to the ground. No
      sir, I don't want to think of it&mdash;how she sank right down in that
      doorway, and her head went over sidewise and her eyes shut and&mdash;and
      her heart stopped, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster blew his nose and snapped his eyes and cleared his throat
      with difficulty. Parker had forgotten his figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gid came round the corner of the house, seeing the team drive up, and
      what do you suppose he said when he saw his brother back from the grave,
      as you might say? He looked him over, not offering to shake his hand, and
      then he says, 'Well, living skelington, it's goin' to cost something to
      plump you out again, ain't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw the look on Josh's face at that, I'd have hauled off and
      cuffed Gid's head up to a pick, swan if I wouldn't, but the Marshall girl&mdash;excuse
      me, Mis' Ward&mdash;came tearin' down the path, and threw her arms round
      Josh's neck and cried, 'O my poor brother!' And I came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too much for me. My eyes were so full that I run against a tree,
      and pretty near took a wheel off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Josh stayed, and as soon as he was able he took a-hold of farm-work,
      and things went along for a time all quiet. One evening Josh was sitting
      out at the corner of the house, smoking as usual, and meditatin' in the
      way he had, when Gid came along and sat down on the door-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;''Bout time to have a business understanding, ain't it, Josh?' Gid asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, perhaps it is,' said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well then, ye'll answer a fair question. If ye continue to stay here,
      where's the money for your board comin' from?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Board?' says Josh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, board! You don't reckon to run a visit over three months, do ye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, I didn't think there'd be any question of this sort between us,
      Gid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Business is business. If you'd had more business to you, you wouldn't be
      a pauper now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A pauper!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's what I said. You deeded this place to Cynthy Marshall, didn't ye?
      Well, she has deeded it to me. 'Tain't much of a husband that don't have
      his property in his own name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But see here, Gideon, you know why I deeded this property. You know how
      matters have come out. Between brothers in such a case there should be no
      such thing as stickin' to the letter of deeds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nearer the relatives be to ye, closer you ought to follow the law,'
      snapped Gid, 'or else ye'll get cheated worse than by a stranger!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He didn't seem to be takin' any of that to himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I've been thinkin' I'd give half the place to Cynthy as a weddin'
      present, and we could&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, you've given it all to her, hain't ye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josh had to say yes, of course. Never was any hand to argue his own
      rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, she has given it to me and it was hers to give. Now, I say, can ye
      pay board?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I haven't any money, Gid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, then, ye'll have to get a job somewhere. I don't need a hired man
      just now. Ye won't starve, Josh. The gov'ment will take care of soldiers,'
      he sneered. Then he got up and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way it was told to me by Joshua Ward himself, Mr. Parker,&rdquo;
       concluded the postmaster. &ldquo;He had to get out. He didn't have any money to
      fight in law. He didn't want to stir up the thing on poor Cynthy's
      account. And he was ashamed to have the whole world know how mean a man he
      had for a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of this Joshua?&rdquo; asked the young man, his heart hot with
      new and fresh bitterness against this unspeakable tyrant of the timber
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josh did what so many other heart-broken men have done. He went into the
      woods, on an island in Little Moxie, built a cabin, has his pension to
      live on, and has become one of those queer old chaps such as you will find
      scattered all the way from Holeb to New Brunswick. There's old Young at
      Gulf Hagas, and the Mediator at Boarstone, and a lot like them. They call
      Joshua the 'cat hermit of Moxie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he's got cats round his place by the hundred. Spends all his
      time in hunting meat and catching fish for 'em. Well, most everybody is
      cranky about some notion or others, whether it's in the city or in the
      woods, and I reckon that Josh has a right to keep cats if he wants to. No
      one ever sees him out in civilization now. Cynthy's in the asylum. Most
      people think it's just the trouble of the thing preying on her mind. And
      then again, I guess that Gid wasn't ever any too good to her. Hard case,
      ain't it, Mr. Parker?&rdquo; The postmaster's voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as sad a story&mdash;as anger-stirring a story as I ever listened
      to, Mr. Dodge,&rdquo; replied the young man, passionately. &ldquo;I cannot understand
      how a scoundrel of that style should have been allowed to stamp roughshod
      over people without a champion arising in some quarter. It is small wonder
      that he has come to think that he can run the universe. He needs a
      lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no doubt about his needin' the lesson,&rdquo; replied the postmaster.
      &ldquo;But for years half the wages that are paid out in this section have come
      through the hands of Gideon Ward. Laboring men with families to support
      and the traders have to stand in with him or be side-tracked. I don't know
      as Gid ever did a real up-and-down crime, any more than what I've been
      telling you&mdash;and some men in the world would be mean enough to gloss
      all that over, saying that it's only right to look out for number one
      first of all. But I tell ye honestly, Mr. Parker, Gid would have to do
      something pretty desperate and open to have the prosecuting officers of
      this county take it up against him. Now you can understand the width of
      the swath he cuts in these parts. Where would the witnesses come from? He
      owns his men, body and soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker's forehead wrinkled doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think will be his next move in regard to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make a guess, but you need smellers as long as a bobcat's and as
      many eyes as a spider.&rdquo; With this cheering opinion expressed, the
      postmaster went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more work for Parker on his plans that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim pathos of the story that he had heard haunted him. This pitiful
      tragedy in real life stirred his youthful and impressionable sensibilities
      to their depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his brave outward demeanor during his tilt with the ferocious old
      man he had feared within himself. He possessed no gladiatorial spirit and
      did not relish fray for the sake of it. But he did have accurate notions
      of right and wrong, of the justice of a cause and of manliness in standing
      for it. He had exhibited that trait many times to the astonishment of
      those who had been deceived by his quiet exterior. In this instance his
      employers had put a trust into his hands. He had resolved to go through
      with his task. But now there was added another incentive&mdash;a very
      distinct determination to give Gideon Ward at least one check and lesson
      in his career of wholesale domination.
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer grief worked in his heart and a wistful tenderness moistened his
      eyes as he thought upon that injured brother, living out his wrecked life
      somewhere in the heart of those great woods about him. Perhaps there was a
      bit of prescience in the warmth with which he dwelt on the subject, for
      Fate had written that Joshua Ward was to play an important part in the
      life of Rodney Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to sleep with the sorrow of it all weighing his mind, and his
      teeth gritting with determination as he reflected on Gideon Ward and his
      ugly threats.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SEVEN&mdash;HOW &ldquo;THE FRESH-WATER CORSAIRS&rdquo; CAME TO SUNKHAZE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning Parker's foreman was waiting for him in the men's room of
      the tavern. It was so early that the smoky kerosine lamp was still
      struggling with the red glow of the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker,&rdquo; said the foreman earnestly, &ldquo;have you go it figured what the
      old chap is goin' to do to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hardly a fair question to put to me Mank,&rdquo; said the engineer,
      pulling on his mittens. &ldquo;You knew him up this way better than I. Now you
      tell me what you expect him to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the foreman shook his head dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll never come at a man twice alike,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes he just snorts and folks just run. Sometimes he kicks,
      sometimes he bites, sometimes he rears and smashes things all to pieces.
      But the idea is, you can depend on him to do something and do it quick and
      do it mighty hard. We've known Gideon Ward a good many years up this way
      and we've never seen him so mad before nor have better reason for being
      mad. The men are worrying. I thought it right to tell you that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm worrying, too,&rdquo; said Parker. He tried to speak jestingly, but
      the heaviness of the night's foreboding was still upon him and the foreman
      detected the nervousness in his voice. The man now showed his own
      depression plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in hopes I could tell the men that you could see your way all free
      and clear&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the men are worrying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they are, sir. A good many of us own houses here in Sunkhaze and
      there's more than one way for Colonel Gideon Ward to get back at us.
      Several of the boys came to me last night and wanted to quit. I understand
      that the postmaster has been talking to you and he must have told you some
      of the things that the old man done and hasn't been troubled about, either
      by his conscience or the law. You see what kind of a position that puts us
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that the crew is going to strike, or rather slip out from
      under, do you, Mank?&rdquo; asked Parker, struck by the man's demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd hardly like to say that. I ain't commissioned to put it that
      strong. But we've got to remember the fact that we'll probably want to
      live here a number of years yet, and railroad building won't last forever.
      Still, it's hardly about future jobs that we're thinking now. It's what is
      liable to happen to us in the next few days. It will be tough times for
      Sunkhaze settlement if the Gideonites swoop down on us, Mr. Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer threw out his arms impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm in no position, Mank, to guarantee safety to the men who are
      working for the company,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It looks to me as tho I were standing
      here pretty nigh single-handed. If I understand your meaning, I can't
      depend on my crew to back me up if it comes to a clinch with the old
      bear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys here are not cowards,&rdquo; replied the foreman with some spirit.
      &ldquo;They're good, rugged chaps with grit in 'em. Turn 'em loose in a woods
      clearing a hundred miles from home and I'd match 'em man for man with any
      crowd that Gid Ward could herd together. I don't say they wouldn't fight
      here in their own door yards, Mr. Parker. They'd fight before they'd see
      their houses pulled down or their families troubled. But as to fighting
      for the property of this railroad company and then taking chances with the
      Gideonites afterward&mdash;well, I don't know about that! It's too near
      home!&rdquo; Again the foreman shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;As long as you can
      reckon safely that the old one is goin' to do something, the boys thought
      perhaps you'd notify the sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Parker remembered his instructions. Reporting his predicament to the
      sheriff would mean sowing news of the Sunkhaze situation broadcast in the
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a matter for the sheriffs,&rdquo; he replied shortly. &ldquo;We'll consider
      that the men are hired to transport material and not to fight. We can only
      wait and see what will happen. But, Mank, I think that when the pinch
      comes you will find that my men can be as loyal to me, even if I am a
      stranger, as Ward's men are to the infernal old tyrant who has abused them
      all these years. I'm going to believe so at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and started out of doors into the crisp morning. &ldquo;I'm going
      to believe that last as long as I can,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll help to keep me from running away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found his crew gathered in the railroad yard near the heaps of unloaded
      material for construction. The men eyed him a bit curiously and rather
      sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how you stand, men,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I don't ask you to
      undertake any impossibilities. I simply want help in getting this stuff
      across Spinnaker Lake. Let's at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone inspired them momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at least dauntless toilers, even if they professed to be
      indifferent soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleds or skids were drawn up into the railroad yard by hand and loaded
      there. Then they were snubbed down to the lake over the steep bank. On the
      ice the &ldquo;train&rdquo; was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Parker himself was surprised to find what a load the little
      locomotive could manage. He made four trips the first day and at dusk had
      the satisfaction of beholding many tons of rails, fish-plates and spikes
      unloaded and neatly piled in the yarding place at the Spinnaker end of the
      carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between trips, while the men were unloading, he had opportunity to extend
      his right-of-way lines for his swampers and attend to other details of his
      engineering problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a swift pace he set!
    </p>
    <p>
      He dared to trust no one else in the cab of the panting &ldquo;Swamp Swogon&rdquo; as
      engineer, and rushed back from his lines when the fireman signalled with
      the whistle that they were ready for a return trip. It may readily be
      imagined that with duties pressing on him in that fashion Parker had
      little time in which to worry about the next move of Colonel Ward. And the
      men worked as zealously as tho they too had forgotten the menace that
      threatened in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three days fully half the weight of material had been safely landed
      across the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the evening of the third day Parker was more seriously alarmed by
      the weather-frowns than he had been by the threats of Gideon Ward himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster presaged it, sniffing into the dusk with upturned nose and
      wagging his head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon old Gid has got one more privilege of these north woods into his
      clutch and is now handlin' the weather for the section,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For if
      we ain't goin' to have a spell of the soft and moist that will put you out
      of business for a while, then I miss my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It began with a fog and ended in a driving rainstorm that converted the
      surface of the lake into an expanse of slush that there was no dealing
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker's experience had been with climatic conditions in lower latitudes
      and in his alarm he believed that spring had come swooping in on him and
      that the storm meant the breaking up of the ice or at least would weaken
      it so that it would not bear his engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the postmaster, who could be a comforter as well as a prophet of ill,
      took him into the little enclosure of his inner office and showed him a
      long list of records pencilled on the slide of his wicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ice was never known to break up in Spinnaker earlier than the first week
      in May,&rdquo; said Dodge, &ldquo;and this rain-spitting won't open so much as a
      riffle. You just keep cool and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the rain-storm the weather helped Parker to keep cool. He
      heard the wind roaring from the northwest in the night. The frame of the
      little tavern shuddered. Ice fragments, torn from eaves and gables, went
      spinning away into the darkness over the frozen crust with the sound of
      the bells of fairy sleighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Parker, fully awakening in the early dawn, looked out upon the frosty
      air, his breath was as visibly voluminous as the puff from an escape-valve
      of the &ldquo;Swogon.&rdquo; With his finger-nail he scratched the winter enameling
      from his window-pane, and through that peep-hole gazed out upon the lake.
      The frozen expanse stretched steel-white, glary and glistening, a solid
      sheet of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a surface,&rdquo; cried Parker, in joyous soliloquy, &ldquo;that will enable
      the Swogon to haul as much as a P. K. &amp; R. mogul! Jack Frost is
      certainly a great engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He at once put a crew at work getting out more saplings for sleds. In two
      more trips, with his extra &ldquo;cars&rdquo; and with that glassy surface, he
      believed that every ounce of railroad material could be &ldquo;yarded&rdquo; at the
      Po-quette Carry. When the sun went down redly, spreading its broad bands
      of radiance across ice-sheeted Spinnaker, the Swogon stood bravely at the
      head of twenty heavily loaded sleds. The start for the Carry was scheduled
      to occur at daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was round and full that evening, and Parker before turning in
      went out and remained at the edge of the lake a moment, looking across
      Spinnaker's vast expanse of silvery glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could take that train acrost the lake to-night, Mr. Parker,&rdquo;
       suggested the foreman, who had followed him from the post-office. &ldquo;It's as
      light as day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; admitted the young man, &ldquo;I just came out with the uneasy
      feeling, somehow, that I ought to fire up and start out. I suppose the old
      women would call it a presentiment. But the men have worked too hard
      to-day to be called out for a night job. With a freeze like that we
      haven't got to hurry on account of the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman patted his ears briskly, for the night wind was sweeping down
      the lake and squalling shrewishly about the corners of buildings in the
      little settlement. Suddenly the man shot out a mittened hand, and pointed
      up the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker gazed. Far up Spinnaker a dim white bulk seemed to hover above the
      ice. It was almost wraith-like in the moonlight. It flitted on like a huge
      bird, and seemed to be rapidly advancing toward Sunkhaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006">

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were summer-time and this were Sandy Hook,&rdquo; said Parker, with a
      smile, &ldquo;I should think that perhaps the cup-race might be on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say, rather, it is the ghost of Gid Ward's boom gunlow,&rdquo;
       returned the man, not to be outdone in jest. &ldquo;He's got an old scow with a
      sail like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men surveyed the dim whiteness with increasing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any ice-boats on the lake?&rdquo; inquired the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of any such thing hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have made that out to be an iceboat of some description. And with
      that spread of sail it is making great progress.&rdquo; Parker rolled up his
      coat collar and pulled down his fur cap. A feeling of disquiet pricked
      him. &ldquo;I think I'll stay here a little while and watch that fellow,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; agreed his employé.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approaching sail grew rapidly. Soon the craft was to be descried more
      in detail. Under the sail was a flat, black mass. And now on the breeze
      came swelling a chorus of rude songs, the melody of which was shot through
      with howls and bellows of uproarious men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble's coming there, Mr. Parker!&rdquo; gasped the foreman, apprehensively.
      &ldquo;The wind behind 'em an' rum inside 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ward's men, eh?&rdquo; suggested the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they are! The Gideonites! They can't be anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get our men together!&rdquo; Parker cried, clapping his gloved hands. &ldquo;Rout out
      every man in the settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman started away on the run, banging on house doors and bawling
      the cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoo-ee! All up! Parker's crew turn out! All hands wanted at the lake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the excitement of the moment Mank did not question the command nor
      pause to reflect that he might be calling his neighbors into trouble that
      they would not relish.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER EIGHT&mdash;THE LOCOMOTIVE THAT WENT SWIMMING AND THE ENGINEER WHO
      WAS STOLEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a few moments the bell of the little chapel was sending its jangling
      alarm out over the village. Doors banged, men burst out of the houses and
      poured down to the lake shore, buttoning their jackets as they ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      They required no explanation. Ever since the incident at Poquette some
      such irruption of Ward's reckless woods hordes had been anticipated. But
      this tempestuous night arrival under sail, this sudden and terrifying
      descent appalled the newly awakened men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The craft was now close to shore, and was making for the stolid Swogon and
      its waiting sleds. The stranger's method of construction could now be
      distinguished, A good half-score of tote-sleds had been lashed together
      into a sort of runnered raft The sail was the huge canvas used in summer
      on Ward's lake scow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the great boat swung into the wind, a jostling crowd of men poured out
      on the ice from under the flapping sail. Each man bore a tool of some
      sort, either ax, cant-dog, iron-shod peavey-stick, or cross-cut saw; and
      the moonshine flashed on the steel surfaces. It was plain that the party
      viewed its expedition as an opportunity for reckless roistering, and
      spirits had added a spur to the natural boisterous belligerency of the
      woodsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of Parker's crew had brought axes, and now as he advanced across the
      ice toward the locomotive, his men followed with considerable display of
      valor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A giant whiskered woodsman led the onrush of the attacking force; and the
      gang interposed itself between the railroad property and its defenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up there, right where ye are, all of ye!&rdquo; the giant shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business here?&rdquo; demanded the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you that little railro'd chap that thinks he's runnin' this end of
      the country on the kid-glove basis?&rdquo; roared the big man. He swung his ax
      menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Parker,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;That is my property yonder.
      You will have to let my men pass to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The giant looked squarely over the engineer's head into the crowd of
      Sunkhaze men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all know me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;an' if ye don't know me ye've heard of me! I
      reckon Dan Connick is pretty well known hereabouts. Wal, that's me. Never
      was licked, never was talked back to. These men behind me are all a good
      deal like me. I know the most o' you men. I should hate to hurt ye. Your
      wives are up there waitin' for ye to come home. Ye'd better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the crowd made no movement to retreat. Parker still stood at their
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'd better go!&rdquo; bellowed Connick. &ldquo;Understand? I said ye'd better go. Go
      an' mind your business, an' if ye do that, not a man in my crew will step
      a foot on the Sunk-haze shore. But if ye stay here and meddle, then down
      come your houses and out go your cook-stoves. You know me! Get back on
      shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous roar from his men emphasized his demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye want these hearties loose up there, ye can have 'em in about two
      minutes!&rdquo; he cried, threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunkhaze contingent rubbed elbows significantly, mumbled in
      conference, and scuffled slowly toward the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to back down, men?&rdquo; Parker shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got wives an' children an' houses up there, mister,&rdquo; said a voice
      from the crowd, &ldquo;an' it's a cold night to be turned out-o'-doors. We know
      these fellers better'n what you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, men,&rdquo; persisted Parker, &ldquo;they won't dare to sack your village. Such
      things are not done in these days. The law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; burst from Connick, jeeringly. &ldquo;Law! Law!&rdquo; echoed his men, with
      mocking laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; yelled Connick, &ldquo;there ain't deputy sheriffs enough in this county
      to round us up once we get acrost the Poquette divide! There ain't a
      deputy sheriff that will dare to poke his nose within ten miles of our
      camps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; agreed one of the Sunkhaze crowd. &ldquo;Once a crew
      burnt a smokin'-car when they were comin' up from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No yarns now, no yarns now!&rdquo; Connick thrust himself against the Sunkhaze
      men and roughly elbowed them back. &ldquo;Get on shore an' stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker was left standing alone on the ice. His supporters scuffled away,
      muttering angry complaints, but offering no resistance. When the giant
      woodsman returned after hastening their departure, he was faced by the
      young man, still defiant. Connick cocked his head humorously and looked
      down on the engineer. Under all the big man's apparent fierceness there
      had been a flash of rough jocoseness in his tones at times. Parker saw
      plainly that he and his followers viewed the whole thing as a &ldquo;lark,&rdquo; and
      entertained little respect for their adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connick, I warn you&mdash;&rdquo; Parker began; but the giant chuckled, and
      said, tauntingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cluck, cluck!' said the bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say to you, sir, that you are dealing with a large proposition
      if you propose to interfere with this railroad property. My backers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bow-wow!' said the fish.&rdquo; The woodsman cried the taunt more insolently,
      and yet with a jeering joviality that irritated Parker more than downright
      abuse would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started toward his engine, but Connick put out his big arm to
      interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poodle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've got a place for you. I'm the champion dog-catcher
      of the West Branch region.&rdquo; He reached for Parker's collar, but Parker
      ducked under his arm, and as he came up struck out with a force that sent
      the astonished giant reeling backward. Fury and desperation were behind
      the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, of all the&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Connick, pushing back his cap and staring
      in astonishment. His men laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll wring your neck, you bantam!&rdquo; he bawled; and he came down on Parker
      with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that slippery surface the odds were with the defensive. Moreover,
      Parker, having an athlete's confidence in his fists, suddenly responded to
      the instincts of primordial man. He leaped lightly to one side, caught the
      rushing giant's foot across his instep, and as Connick's moccasined feet
      went out from under him, the young engineer struck him behind the ear. He
      fell with a dismal thump of his head on the ice, and lay without motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Parker's panting triumph was shortlived. As he stood over the giant,
      gallantly waiting for him to rise, he discovered that the rules of
      scientific combat were not observed in the woods. A half-dozen brawny
      woodsmen leaped upon him, seized him, threw him down, tied his arms and
      legs with as little ceremony as if he were a calf, and tossed him upon the
      ice-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connick had risen to a sitting posture, and viewed the struggle with
      mutterings of wrath while he rubbed his bumped head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scrambled up as if to interfere, but as his antagonist had by this time
      been disposed of, he roared a few sharp orders, and his willing crew set
      at work. Men with axes chopped holes a few feet apart in a circle about
      the engine. There were many choppers, and although the ice was three feet
      thick, the water soon came bubbling through. As soon as a hole was cut,
      other men stuck down their huge cross-cuts and began to saw the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      All too soon Parker, craning his neck where he lay on the ice-boat, heard
      an ominous buckling and crackling of ice, and saw his faithful Swogon
      disappear below the surface of the lake, her mighty splash sending the
      water gushing like a silvery geyser into the moonlight. The attached
      sleds, loaded with the rails and spikes and other material, followed like
      a line of huge, frightened beavers seeking their hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; ejaculated Connick, wiping the sweat from his brow, &ldquo;when that
      hole freezes up the Poquette Carry Railro'd will be canned for a time,
      anyway. Now three cheers for Colonel Gid Ward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheers were howled vociferously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the men of the settlement, who were now joined by their
      wives and children, and were watching operations from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for the brave men and the sweet ladies o' Sunkhaze!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud laughter followed these cheers. The people on the shore remained
      discreetly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three groans for the Poquette Railro'd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hoarse cries rang out on the crisp night wind, and at the close one of
      those queer, splitting, wide-reaching, booming crackles, heard in the
      winter on big waters, spread across the lake from shore to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the old lake's with us!&rdquo; a woodsman shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connick and his men had finished what they had come to Sunkhaze to do.
      They climbed aboard the huge ice-craft. The sheet was paid off, and with
      dragging peavey-sticks instead of centerboard to hold the contrivance into
      the wind, the boat moved away on its tack across the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say good-by to your friend here!&rdquo; Connick bellowed. &ldquo;He says he thinks
      he'll go with us, strange country for to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell inquirin' admirers that his address in futur' will be north pole,
      shady side,&rdquo; another rough humorist added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men on the shore did not reply. They understood perfectly the
      uncertain temper of &ldquo;larking&rdquo; woodsmen. There had been cases in times past
      when a taunting word had turned rude jollity into sour hankering for
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottle began to go about on the sleds, and the refrain of a
      lumberman's chorus, with its riotous, &ldquo;Whoop fa la larry, lo day!&rdquo; came
      floating back to Sunkhaze long after the great sail had merged itself with
      the silvery radiance of the brilliant surface of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently there's other folks as have new schemes of travellin' acrost
      Spinnaker Lake,&rdquo; observed the postmaster, breaking a long silence in the
      group of spectators. &ldquo;Wal, I did all I could to post him on what he might
      expect when Gid Ward got his temper good an' started. It's too bad to see
      that property dumped that way, tho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't Gid Ward ever goin' to suffer for any of his actions?&rdquo; demanded
      Parker's foreman, disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we goin' to do?&rdquo; bleated another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll write a letter to the high sheriff,&rdquo; said the postmaster, and then
      he added, bitterly, &ldquo;an' he'll prob'ly wait till it's settled goin' in the
      spring, same's he did when we sent down that complaint about Ward's men
      wreckin' Johnson's store. An' by that time he'll forget all about comin'.
      Talk about kings and emperors! If we hain't got one on West Branch waters,
      then you can brand me for a liar with one of my own date stamps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker maintained grim silence as he lay on the sled. No one spoke to him.
      The men were too busy with songs and rough jests over the business of the
      evening. The engineer would not confess to himself that he was frightened,
      but the wantonness and alacrity with which the irresponsible men had
      destroyed valuable property impressed him with ominous apprehension of
      what they might do to him. He wondered what revenge Connick was
      meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange and tedious ride for the young man. The woodsmen sat
      jammed so closely about him that he could see only the frosty stars
      glimmering wanly in the moonlight. When the songs and the roaring
      conversations were stilled for a moment, he could hear the lisp of the
      runners on the smooth surface and the slashing grind of the iron-clad
      peavey-sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the bodies of his neighbors had kept the cold blast from him, he
      staggered on his numb feet when they untied his bonds at Poquette and
      ordered him to get off the sled. Connick came along and gazed on the young
      man grimly while they were freeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, my bantam!&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker braced himself to meet a blow. He felt that the giant would now
      take satisfactory vengeance for the discomfiture he had suffered before
      his men at Sunkhaze. Connick raised his hand, that in its big mitten
      seemed like a cloud against the moon, and brought it down. The young man
      gathered himself apprehensively, but the expected assault was merely a
      slap on his shoulder&mdash;a slap with such an unmistakable air of
      friendliness about it that Parker gazed up into the man's face with
      astonishment. Now he was to experience his first taste of the rude
      chivalry of the woods, a chivalry often based on sudden whim, but none the
      less sincere and manly&mdash;a chivalry of which he was to have further
      queer experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bantam,&rdquo; said the big man, admiringly, &ldquo;faith, but that was a tidy
      bito' footwork ye done down at Sunkhaze.&rdquo; Good-humored grins and rueful
      scowls chased one another over his face, according as he patted Parker's
      back or rubbed the bump on his own head. &ldquo;Sure, there's a big knob there,
      my boy. There's only one thing that's harder than your fist, an' that's
      Spinnaker ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker attempted some embarrassed reply in way of apology, for this
      magnanimity of his foe touched him. The giant put up a protesting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye sartin done it good, my little man, an' I'm glad to know ye better.
      But Colonel Gid Ward, sure he lied about ye, or I'd never called ye names
      at Sunkhaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't expect that man to tell the truth about me, did you?&rdquo; Parker
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he said ye was a little white-livered sneak that wouldn't dare to
      put up your hands to a Sunkhaze mosquito of the June breed, an' that ye
      were tryin' to come in here an' do business amongst real men. I couldn't
      stand that, I couldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my business&mdash;my reasons for being here&mdash;my
      responsibilities!&rdquo; cried Parker. &ldquo;I see he must have lied about that part
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I don't know anything about your business, nor care!&rdquo; Connick
      growled. &ldquo;I only know there's something about a Poquette railro'd in it.
      But all that's between you and Gid Ward. You can talk that over with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you and your men have destroyed that railroad
      property without having any special grudge against the project?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, railro'ds ain't any of our business,&rdquo; the giant replied, with his
      eyes wide open and frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you&mdash;slaves?&rdquo; Parker cried, angrily. In addition to his
      lesson in woods' thivalry he was getting education regarding the
      irresponsibility of these unconventional children of the wild lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The taunt did not seem to anger the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This railro'd is Gid Ward's business,&rdquo; said Connick. &ldquo;We work for Gid
      Ward, He owns the Poquette land, don't he? He said he didn't want any
      railro'd there. He told us to come down an' dump the thing. We come down,
      of course it's been dumped. You can fix that with him. But you're a good
      little fighter, my man. He didn't tell the truth about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man groaned. The ethics of the woods were growing more opaque to
      his understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll introduce myself more formal,&rdquo; said the woodsman, apparently with
      affable intent to be better acquainted with this young man who had shown
      that he possessed the qualities admired in the forest. &ldquo;My name is Dan
      Connick, and these here are my hearties from Number 7 cuttin'.&rdquo; He waved
      his hand, and the nearest men growled good-humored greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Connick,&rdquo; said Parker, dryly, &ldquo;I thank you for the evening's
      entertainment, and now that you have done your duty to Colonel Ward I
      suppose I may return to Sunkhaze.&rdquo; His heart sank as he thought of the
      poor Swogon weltering in the depths of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye've got to come along with us!&rdquo; beamed Connick. &ldquo;Colonel Ward has
      sent for ye!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER NINE&mdash;UP THE WINDING WAY TO THE &ldquo;OGRE OF THE BIG WOODS.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no further business with Colonel Ward at this time,&rdquo; protested
      Parker, amazed at Connick's refusal to release him. &ldquo;Wal, he says you
      have, an' them's our orders. The men that work for Gid Ward have to obey
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Colonel Ward has already injured me enough,&rdquo; exclaimed Parker,
      bitterly, &ldquo;without dragging me away into the woods fifty or a hundred
      miles from my duty! I'll not see any more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but ye will, tho!&rdquo; Connick was grinning, but under his amiability his
      tones were decisive. &ldquo;I don't know what he wants to talk with you about,
      but I reckon it's railroad. We here can't do that with ye. So ye'll have
      to come along. But we all think you're a smart little man. Ain't that so,
      hearties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men growled gruff assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, ye're pop'lar with us,&rdquo; Connick went on. &ldquo;Ye can be as friendly
      with us as tho we was your brothers, but ye don't want to try any
      shenanigan trick like dodgin' away. We've been told to take you to Number
      7 camp, and to that camp ye're goin'. So understandin' that we'll move.
      There's a snack waitin' here for us at the carry camp, and then for the
      uptrail.&rdquo; The men moved along, taking Parker with them in the center of
      the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it to Number 7?&rdquo; the young man inquired, despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call it fifty miles from the other end of the carry. Ye needn't walk
      a step if ye don't want to. There's a moose sled an' plenty of men to haul
      ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a breakfast of hot beans, biscuits and steaming tea at the camp, the
      procession moved. Parker was wrapped in tattered bunk blankets and
      installed in state on a long, narrow sledge. He was given the option of
      getting off and walking whenever he needed the exercise to warm himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The march was brisk all that day, for the brawny woodsmen followed the
      snowy trail unflaggingly. After the six miles of the carry tote-road,
      their way led up the crooked West Branch on the ice. There were detours
      where the open waters roared down rough gorges fast enough to dodge the
      chilling hand of Jack Frost; there were broad dead waters where the river
      widened into small lakes. Parker was oppressed by the nervous dread of one
      who enters a strange new country and faces a danger toward which a fate
      stronger than he is pressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon they ate a lunch beside a crackling fire which warmed the cooked
      provisions they had brought from the carry camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker walked during the afternoon to ease his cold-stiffened limbs.
      Toward dusk the party left the river and turned into a tote-road that
      writhed away under snow-laden spruces and hemlocks, coiled its way about
      rocky hummocks, and curved in &ldquo;whip-lashes&rdquo; up precipitous hillsides.
      There was not a break in the forest that stretched away on either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening they saw in a valley below them a group of log huts,
      their snowy roofs silvered by the moonlight. Yellow gleams from the low
      windows showed that the camp was occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the Sourdanheunk baitin'-place,&rdquo; Connick explained, in answer to a
      question from his captive. &ldquo;One o' Ward's tote-team hang-ups an'
      feedin'-places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook, a sallow, tall man encased in a dirty canvas shroud of an apron,
      was apparently expecting the party. More beans, more biscuits, more
      steaming tea&mdash;and then a bunk was spread for Parker. His previous
      night of vigil and his day spent in the wind had benumbed his faculties,
      and he speedily forgot his fears and his bitter resentment in profound
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the cook's &ldquo;Whoo-ee!&rdquo; called the men before the dawn, and
      they were away while the first flushes presaged the sunrise. It seemed
      that day that the tortuous tote-road would never end. Valley succeeded to
      &ldquo;horseback&rdquo; and &ldquo;horseback&rdquo; to valley. Woods miles are long miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker's railroad eye and engineer's discernment bitterly condemned the
      divagations of the wight who wandered first along that trail and imposed
      his lazy dodgings on all who might come after him. The young man amused
      himself by reflecting that the tote-road was an excellent example of the
      persistence of human error, and in these and other philosophical
      ponderings he was able to draw his mind partially from its uncomfortable
      dwellings on the probabilities awaiting him at the hands of Gideon Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was far down in the west and the road under the spruces was dusky,
      when a singular obstacle halted the march. A tremendous thrashing and
      crashing at one side of the road signaled the approach of some large
      animal. A network of undergrowth hid the identity of this unknown, and the
      men instinctively huddled together and displayed some uncertainty as to
      whether they should remain or run. But the suspense was soon over, for the
      nearer bushes parted suddenly and out upon the tote-road floundered an
      immense moose, his bulbous nose wagging, his bristly mane twitching, his
      stilted fore legs straddled defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment a great bellow of laughter went up from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joke's on us!&rdquo; cried a woodsman, who had been among the first to
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Ben Bouncer!&rdquo; Connick shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by playin' peek-a-boo with your friends in that manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moose uttered a hoarse <i>whuffle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Ben Bouncer, the mascot of Number 7 camp,&rdquo; the foreman announced.
      He pushed Parker to the front rank of the group. &ldquo;He won't hurt ye,&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;He has got used enough to men to be a little sassy, an' he's got
      colty on Gid Ward's grain, but he's mostly bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer gazed on the moose with considerable interest, for the
      spectacle was entirely new.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben went to loafin' round 7 camp early this winter. He yarded down here
      two miles or so. You understand, of course, that a moose picks out a good
      feedin'-place in winter, when the deep snows come, a place where he can
      reach a lot of twigs and yards there, as they call it in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the snow got crusty and scraped his legs, Ben seemed to have a tired
      fit come over him, and began to come closer an' closer to the horse hovels
      to steal what loose hay he could. No one round the camp wanted to hurt
      him. After a time we all became sort of interested in him, and toled him
      up to the camp by leavin' hay an' grain round where he could get at it.
      You can see what a big fat fellow we've made of him. Our feedin' him makes
      the colonel mad, for hay is worth something by the time ye get it in here
      to camp. I bet if ye put it all together the colonel has chased him more'n
      forty miles with a bow whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was goin' to shoot Ben, but the boys got up on their ear and made it
      known that if he killed the camp mascot they'd throw up their jobs. An' if
      you know anything about a woods crew you'd know it's the little things
      that they get the maddest about. An' now whenever the colonel comes round
      he takes it out in chasin' Ben with a whip. Ben just lopes round in a
      circle of a mile or two, and comes back lookin' reproachful, but still
      perfectly satisfied with Number 7 as a winter residence. The boys think a
      lot of Ben. Ben thinks a lot of the boys. But the colonel is sp'ilin' his
      temper some with that bow whip. I reckon why Ben jest come out there
      lookin' so savage was because he thought old Ward was comin' up to camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moose finished his critical survey of the group, snorted, and then
      thrust himself out of sight in the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we ever have any serious fallin' out with Colonel Gid it's like to be
      over that moose,&rdquo; drawled a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To judge by the moose, we must be near Number 7 camp,&rdquo; Parker suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just over the hossback,&rdquo; was the laconic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker was soon looking down on it from the hilltop. There were two long,
      low main camps&mdash;one for the sleeping quarters of the men, the other
      crowded with long, roughly made tables, at which they ate, The space that
      separated the camps was roofed and had one side open to the weather. This
      shelter was called the &ldquo;dingle,&rdquo; and contained the camp grindstone and
      spare sled equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little distance was a small camp containing the stores, such as
      moccasins, larigans, leggings, flannel shirts and mittens, all for sale at
      double the prices ruling in the city and for Colonel Ward's profit. The
      woods name for this store is the &ldquo;wangan camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hour was still too early for the few men left at Number 7 to be in
      from the cutting. Only the cook and his helper, &ldquo;the cookee,&rdquo; were at the
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook came out and advanced to meet the new arrivals, having been
      attracted from his kettles and pans by the view-halloo they sent down from
      the hilltop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel left word to lock him in the wangan,&rdquo; reported the cook, rolling
      his bare arms more tightly in his dingy apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the colonel?&rdquo; asked Connick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's out at the log landin'. Be in at supper-time, so he said.&rdquo; The cook
      eyed the captive with curiosity not unmixed with commiseration. &ldquo;Has he
      been takin' on much?&rdquo; he inquired of one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. Stiff upper lip&mdash;an' he licked Dan,&rdquo; the man added, behind his
      palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; the cook ejaculated, looking on Parker with new interest. &ldquo;Ain't he
      worried by thinkin' of the colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw-w! Says he'll eat him raw!&rdquo; fabricated the men, enjoying the cook's
      amazement. &ldquo;Says he's glad to come up here. Been hankerin' to get at Ward,
      he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you don't say!&rdquo; The cook surveyed Parker from head to foot with
      critical inspection. This scrutiny annoyed the young man at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I owe you anything?&rdquo; He snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heh&mdash;wal&mdash;blorh-h&mdash;wal, I hope ye don't!&rdquo; spluttered the
      cook, retreating. &ldquo;Land, ain't he a savage one?&rdquo; he gasped, as he hastened
      back into his realm of pots. He transferred his news to the amazed cookee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he magnified, so as not to be outdone in sensationalism,
      &ldquo;that this feller has licked every man that they've turned him loose on
      between here and Sunkhaze, an' now is just grittin' his teeth a-waitin'
      for the colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the cookee, solemnly, &ldquo;if the r'yal Asiatic tiger&mdash;meanin'
      Colonel Gid&mdash;and the great human Bengal&mdash;meanin' him as is in
      the wangan&mdash;get together in this clearin', I think I'd rather see it
      from up a tree.&rdquo; And the two were only diverted from their breathless
      discussion of possibilities by the noisy arrival of Gideon Ward, clamoring
      for his supper.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Parker had hardly finished in solitude his humble supper brought by the
      cookee, when there was a rattling of the padlock outside. Open flew the
      door of bolted planks, and Colonel Ward stamped in, kicking the snow from
      his feet with wholly unnecessary racket of boots. A hatchet-faced man,
      whose chin was framed between the ends of a drooping yellow mustache,
      followed meekly and closed the door. Parker rose with a confident air he
      was far from feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward gazed on his prisoner a moment, his gray hair bristling from under
      his fur cap, his little eyes glittering maliciously. His cheek knobs were
      more irately purple than ever. He took up his cry where he had left it at
      Poquette Carry, and began to shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better'n law, hey? Better'n law! Ye remember what I said, don't yeh?
      Better'n law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ward, there's a law against trespass, a law against conspiracy, a
      law against riots and destruction of property, and a law against
      abduction. I promise you here and now that you'll learn something about
      those laws later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still threat'nin' me right on my own land, are yeh, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not threatening. I am simply standing up for my rights as a citizen
      under the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I ain't here to argue law nor nothin' else with yeh. I've had you
      brought up here so's I can talk straight business with you. You've had a
      pretty tart lesson, but I hope you've learned somethin' by it. I've showed
      ye that a railro'd can't be built over Gideon Ward's property till he says
      the word. An' he'll never say the word. Ye're licked. Own up to it, now
      ain't ye?&rdquo; Ward's voice was mighty with a conqueror's confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by any means. You have simply incurred the penalty of being sent to
      state prison. And while you're there I'll be building that railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fury fairly streamed from Ward's eyes. He choked, grasped at his throat,
      writhed as if he were strangling, and stamped his foot until the camp
      shook. At last he recovered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll pay ye for that! Now see here!&rdquo; He jammed a paper into Parker's
      hands. &ldquo;Sign that docyment, there an' now. Sign it an' swear ye'll stick
      by your agreement; 'cause if ye go back on it, may the Lord have mercy on
      your soul, for Gid Ward never will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker glanced at the crudely drawn agreement. It bound him as agent for
      his principals to withdraw all material from the Po-quette Carry, and
      abandon his railroad undertaking. It furthermore promised that he would
      make no complaint on account of damages to property or himself&mdash;admitting
      that he had been guilty of trespass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker indignantly held the paper toward the colonel. The latter refused
      to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign it!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Sign it, or you'll take your medicine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am a fool, Colonel Ward? Or are you one? I cannot bind my
      principals in any such manner. Furthermore, a signature obtained under
      duress is of no value in court. I claim that I am under duress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to sign, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. It would be easy enough to sign that paper and then go away
      and do as I like. But I am not going to lie to you even for a moment. The
      paper would be worthless in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't a paper that's goin' into court,&rdquo; Ward retorted. &ldquo;It's a paper
      by which you agree to get out of here. It's you an' me. It just means that
      ro'd shan't be built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put into other words, I am to be scared out, and run back home and report
      that the road is impracticable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no one else in the world but you that would be fool enough to
      start in here an' buck me!&rdquo; Ward shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore you think if I agree to leave, no one else will dare to
      undertake the thing? You do me too much honor, Colonel Ward. But I repeat,
      I shall not run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you realize I have gone too far into this thing to pull back now? I
      warn you that I may have to do things I don't like to do in order to
      protect myself. I can't back out now&mdash;no, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't have started in, then!&rdquo; Parker sat down and looked away as
      if the incident were closed. He slowly tore up the agreement and tossed
      the pieces on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bravado made Ward choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand right up, do you, an' threaten to put me into state prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went into this with your eyes open. You must take the consequences.
      You are a business man, and are supposed to have arrived at years of
      understanding. This matter isn't like kicking over a mud house at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I've got every lumber operator in this section behind me in
      this matter. You hain't realized yet what you're up against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; Parker replied, his eyes kindling, &ldquo;I can see that
      this state is in for one of the big scandals of its history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ward, who had been carried away by his passion and desire to intimidate,
      understood now how this admission would compromise men who would be ruined
      politically if any hint of such an illegal combination should be noised
      abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had offered to defeat the actual construction of the road, he had
      been warned that he must take all the responsibility upon himself. He had
      willingly assumed it, for he was as proud of his reputation for savage
      obstinacy as other men are of popular credit for more noble attributes.
      Col. Gideon Ward had confidently boasted to his associates that he would
      prevent the building of the Poquette railroad. He would rather lose half
      his fortune than confess to them that he had been beaten by a youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his hardy nature shivered at the thought that not only might the youth
      win, but that he had the power to make the agent of the timber barons
      doubly execrated and an outcast among his own people. Ward was faced by
      the most serious problem of his life, and the uncomfortable reflection
      pricked him that he had allowed his anger to steal his brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I've been on earth a good while longer'n you have.
      I expect to stay some time yet. And I expect to live right here in this
      section. <i>You</i> hain't got to live here. Now do you think Gid Ward can
      afford to be put on his back just yet? I know just who'd tromp on me, an'
      I know it better'n you. Now I tell you fair an' square you've got to give
      in.&rdquo; He bellowed the word &ldquo;got&rdquo; and thunked his fist on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no answer to that required from me, Colonel Ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. Come along, Hackett!&rdquo; Ward commanded. &ldquo;We'll give this
      critter a little time to figure this thing over, an' think whether he's
      got any friends that he'd like to get back to.&rdquo; They went out and locked
      the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TEN&mdash;THE WANGAN DUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      AFTER the fashion of any prisoner, Parker's initial impulse was to examine
      the place in which he was confined. At first, escape was in his mind. The
      more he pondered on the lawless performance of the old timber baron and on
      the wilful destruction of the company's property, the more eager he was to
      get to a telegraph instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had been taken from his person. He had his huge, sharp,
      jack-knife. The door was strong and thick but he believed that if he
      attacked the wood vigorously he might be able to whittle out the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were wooden bars on the windows outside and within, rude protection
      against thieves who might want to ransack the stock of the wangan store.
      His stout knife would take care of them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after whittling vigorously at a bar for a few moments he stopped
      suddenly, shut his knife and rammed it into his pocket with an exclamation
      of sudden resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected that even if he got out of the camp that night, he was more
      than fifty miles from Poquette, the only point in that wilderness whose
      location was known to him. He was without food for a journey and had his
      weary way to make through Gideon Ward's own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has brought me here to bluster at me and frighten me into running away
      out of the section,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I'll stay and disappoint him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His own respect for law and order was still so strong within him that he
      feared no extreme measures. His honest belief was that the colonel, like
      most men who find they have picked up a brick too hot for them, would drop
      him in good time and allow him to return to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to force the old man to this issue he determined to put on a bold
      front, defy his captor still more doggedly and in the end accept release
      under conditions of his own making. He felt that Ward was compromised and
      now to a certain extent in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a decidedly comforting reflection, that, for a prisoner, and he
      tucked himself into the blankets of his bunk and went to sleep with his
      mind eased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook's shrill morning call woke him and without rising he listened to
      the bustle of men preparing for the day's work. He heard the continuous
      rattle of tin dishes, the mellow rasp of axes on turning grindstones, the
      squeak of footsteps departing over the crisp snow and the squealing of the
      runners of sleds. And when all were gone, there was as yet only the
      faintest glimmering of the dawn against the window of the wangan camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was up and dressed when the key rattled in the door. Colonel
      Ward came first, &ldquo;sipping&rdquo; his tongue against his teeth in a manner that
      showed he had just finished breakfast. The morning light showed redly on
      his face as he came ill, and in that glow he seemed to be in more gracious
      spirit than on the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had previously accompanied him, the man of the hatchet visage,
      followed at his heels bearing several tin dishes that contained breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no intention here to starve ye nor use ye in any ways
      contrary to gen'ral regulations&mdash;that is, so fur as we can help,&rdquo;
       began the colonel. &ldquo;Of course, if you were a little more reasonable and
      bus'ness-like we could use you better. Hackett, set down the breakfast!
      Fall to, young man, and eat hearty jest as tho ye relished your vittles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Colonel Ward was making desperate attempts to appear
      cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even endeavored to force a smile but it was hardly more than a ridging
      of his cheek muscles under his bristly beard. Parker imagined that he
      could hear the skin crackling at this unaccustomed facial twist. The
      struggle to appear cheerful was so grim that the engineer dreaded his
      antagonist in this new guise more than he did when he was brutally open in
      his warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Hackett,&rdquo; commanded the colonel. &ldquo;Hackett's a friend o' mine&mdash;that
      is, in so far as I have friends, and he might as well be here to listen to
      what I have to say to you and what you have to say to me. There's northin'
      like a witness of transactions, Mr. Parker. Now you and me ain't got
      together right up to now. I'm allus pretty much fussed up by my bus'ness
      and kept cross-grained all the time by havin' to handle so many blasted
      fool woodsmen, and the man that meets me for the first time might
      natch-rally think I was uglier'n a Injun devil in fly-time&mdash;which I
      ain't, Parker, No, I ain't I want you and me should be good friends and
      bus'ness men together, which we ain't been so far, all on account of a
      misunderstandin'. Now, you're goin' to find me square and honest and
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ward looked at the young man eagerly and waited as tho for some
      encouraging word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even under the circumstances in which you have placed me, not only on my
      personal account but with my employers, by destroying their property,&rdquo;
       said Parker, after pondering a moment, &ldquo;I am ready to talk business with
      you if you are now ready to talk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let's say that we can talk it all nice and friendly. Won't you say
      that you'll talk it all nice and friendly?&rdquo; He had Hackett in the corner
      of his eye, as tho soliciting that individual to take careful note of the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Colonel Ward,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;human nature isn't to
      be driven to and fro quite like an ox team. What I mean by that is, I
      might say, 'Go to, now! Be friends!'&mdash;say that to myself. But that
      wouldn't make me feel friendly&mdash;not in present circumstances. But I'm
      going to say to you that I'd like to be friends, and if you will start in
      now and show me some reason why we should be friends I'll give you my word
      to come more than half way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that sounds reasonable and as much as any one can expect on short
      notice,&rdquo; broke in Hackett, who sat straining his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up, Hackett,&rdquo; roared the colonel, who realized Parker's mental
      reservation better than his man Friday. &ldquo;I'll show ye all in good time why
      we should be friends, Parker,&rdquo; he went on, addressing the engineer. &ldquo;But
      first of all I'll show ye how much it is goin' to hurt me to have that
      railroad built acrost Poquette. And when I show you that, then you'll
      understand what the trouble was that you and me didn't start in on the
      basis of good friends. I tell ye, Parker, it's a serious proposition for
      me and my associates. I can tell ye just why that road can't and mustn't
      be built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man straddled his legs, leaned forward and set his right
      forefinger into his left palm with the confident air of one who is
      prepared to prove his contentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the road must not be built, and as a business
      man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ward,&rdquo; broke in Parker, mildly yet firmly, &ldquo;if that line of talk
      is what you are proposing to me I think I'd better tell you at the start
      that you'll have to take the question of whether the road must or must not
      be built to my employers. I have no right to enter upon any such
      discussion. Nothing will be gained. They have sent me to Poquette to build
      the road. I shall keep on with the work until my first orders are
      countermanded from our headquarters. And if you want them countermanded
      you'll be obliged to go to headquarters. It seems to me that ought to be
      pretty plain to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, his finger still boring his palm, sat for some moments and
      stared at the engineer. He tried to keep from scowling but his brows
      twisted into knots in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> keep on till orders are countermanded, hey?&rdquo; he inquired
      grimly. &ldquo;Ain't you got no commonsense nor reason to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a question of that, Colonel. It's a question of obeying my
      employers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man gave him another thorough looking-over and then whirled on
      Hackett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go 'tend to something else,&rdquo; he ordered bluffly. And after Hackett
      had closed the door on himself he again turned to his scrutiny of the
      young engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't no great hand to beat about the bush, young feller,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;Now look at the position you're in. You might say, you're more than half
      queered already with your company. Your engine and all that collateral has
      been dumped into the lake&mdash;sayin' nothin' about how it happened. The
      main point is, it's there! And you're here! I ain't makin' any threats&mdash;not
      as yet&mdash;but you're here, and you can't gainsay that much. Now the
      idea is, with your stuff under water and you here, how long do you think
      it's goin' to be before you git to work ag'in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Needn't answer any question that you can't answer,&rdquo; continued Ward. &ldquo;And
      that's one that you can't answer. You tell me you've got to build that
      road. You're goin' to tell me that if you don't build it some one else
      will. Mebbe they will! Mebbe they will!&rdquo; His eyes grew shrewd. &ldquo;Mebbe I'll
      build it myself! I can say this much, that I'd rather build it than have
      outsiders come in here and git a foothold. There's too big interests in
      this region and owned by them that's allus lived here, my son, to have
      outsiders come in now and meddle. It's the very first run of potater bugs
      that you want to keep out of the garden. And the first run can be handled
      easier than the settlers after they have set up housekeeping. Now you see
      the point, I reckon! So the whole thing simmers down to this: I want to
      discourage them city fellers. It's a long arm they're reachin' down this
      way, and I won't have to tread on their fingers many times till they'll be
      mighty glad to pull back. It's only a side issue with them, and they won't
      let a side issue keep 'em awake too many nights when there's a way to get
      rid of the bother. When they are discouraged enough to be willin' to sell
      the charter and the stuff they've got on the spot&mdash;and under water,&rdquo;
       he added with a wicked grin, &ldquo;then I'll step in with the cash in my hand.
      I reckon we can handle our own railroad build-in' down this way. If I
      ain't got you discouraged already, young man, then I don't understand
      human natur' as well as I think I do. So now I want to hire you in the
      discouragin' business&mdash;you understand it fairly well. I need an
      assistant discourager. And here's my proposition! I'll give ye five
      thousand dollars bonus smack down in your fist and promise you in the name
      of the Lumbermen's Association a steady job. We're goin' to build three
      big dams along the West Branch and a four-mile canal cut-off at
      headwaters. You'll find work enough, if that's what you're lookin' for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll be looking for me to sell out your interests at my first
      opportunity,&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours is a different proposition&mdash;a different proposition,&rdquo; blurted
      Ward earnestly. &ldquo;Your men ain't got any right to be here on our own
      stamping ground&mdash;not as bus'ness men. We ain't goin' down where they
      are to bother them. They hadn't ought to be up here. If you leave 'em and
      come with us we'll consider that it's showin' that you understand what a
      square deal in bus'ness matters means. And furthermore,&rdquo; he said with a
      certain air as tho he had reserved his trump card, &ldquo;we'll make our trade
      in black and white for a ten years' contract at a third more wages than
      your railroad people are paying and tip you off regular on timber deals
      where you can make an extry dollar. I don't mind tellin' ye, Parker, that
      I've had ye looked up and I know that we ain't buyin' any gold brick.&rdquo;
       This with a certain cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, Colonel Ward, that you have taken a rather peculiar method of
      getting me interested in your enterprises.&rdquo; Parker's tone was a bit
      resentful, but the old man believed he could understand that resentment,
      and grew more cheerful and confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had to be discouraged,&rdquo; chuckled the colonel. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you that
      you had to be discouraged? Why, if you hadn't been shown what kind of a
      proposition you were up against you might have kept on thinkin' that the
      P. K. &amp;. R. railroad company was the biggest thing in the world. All
      young men want to work for the biggest folks. But I reckon by this time
      you have found out that Gideon Ward and the Lumbermen's Association come
      pretty near bein' lord of all they survey in this country. There, young
      man! The cards are down. Look at 'em! I'm pretty rough and I'm pretty
      tough and I play the game for all that's in me. But when it's over you
      won't find any cards up my sleeve nor down the back of my neck&mdash;and
      you can't always say that of your smooth city chaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker sat with his elbows on his knees, looking down at the floor, his
      forehead wrinkled. He was a pretty sturdy young American in principles and
      conduct, but at the same time he had all of young America's appreciation
      of the main chance. And the main chance in these days lies along the road
      where the dollars are sprinkled thickest. He reflected that the building
      of the little bob-tail railroad had been tossed at him as a rather silly
      and secret escapade of two big men who were already half ashamed of the
      whole business. He realized that in their present frame of mind they would
      be inclined to close out the whole thing in disgust as soon as they
      received news of the destruction of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got back to town he would simply remind them of a mutual failure
      to accomplish, and the history of such reminders is that they have been
      side-tracked in some places where their presence could not remind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there isn't goin' to be any hurry about your givin' up your
      present job&mdash;not till spring has got well opened and the ice is out
      of Spinnaker,&rdquo; said Colonel Ward slyly, breaking in on the young man's
      meditations. &ldquo;There's always a right time for re-signin' and we'll
      discover that time. But your five thousand will be put to your credit in
      Kenduskeag Bank the next day after you sign our papers, and your salary
      with us will begin the minute the ink is dry. You'll have double pay for a
      while, but I reckon you'll be earnin' it.&rdquo; He chuckled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker, surveying his red cheek knobs, his cruel gray eyes narrowed now in
      evil mirth, recollected with a photographic flash of memory of the details
      of that story the postmaster at Sunkhaze had told him. This was the same
      man who had coolly stolen wife and property from his own brother and then
      had jeered at him, probably with that same expression puckering about his
      evil, gray eyes. In the sudden revulsion of his feelings Parker wondered
      if he really had been tempted by the bait held out to him. At least, he
      had been weighing the chances. He remembered cases where other men who had
      stopped to weigh advantages had ended in becoming disloyal. He promptly
      forgot with a mental wrench the bribe that had been offered. It was a
      coaxing bait and he bravely owned that it had tempted for a moment. He was
      honest enough to own to himself that, offered by another, it might have
      won him&mdash;and he felt a little quiver of fear at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he pictured himself as the associate of this old harpy who sat
      leering at him, hands on his knees, and already swelling with a sense of
      proprietorship, he almost forgot his personal wrongs in the hot flush of
      his indignation on behalf of the cheated brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a proposition that sort of catches ye, hey?&rdquo; inquired Ward,
      misunderstanding the nature of the flush that sprung to Parker's cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be honest enough to say that it did catch me for a moment,&rdquo;
       replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know all about what temptation is to any men&mdash;especially a
      young man,&rdquo; said the colonel blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll bet you a hundred dollars to a toothpick you never knew what it
      was to resist temptation,&rdquo; shouted Parker. &ldquo;And I'm going to tell you now
      and here that I'd no more accept your offer and take a job with you than
      I'd poison myself with paris green.&rdquo; He flung himself back in his chair
      and glared at his tempter with honest indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while Ward stared at him, open-mouthed. His surprise was
      greater, for he believed that he had landed his fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't you make me any more offers. I've no use for them or for you,
      either,&rdquo; cried the young man, his voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've read about such critters as you be,&rdquo; said the colonel slowly, &ldquo;but
      it was in a dime novel and it was a good many years ago and I didn't
      believe it. I believe it said in the novel that the young man died young
      and went to heaven&mdash;the only one of his kind. P'raps I'm wrong and he
      didn't die&mdash;went to heaven jest as he stood in his shoes and co't and
      pants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker merely scowled back at the biting irony of this rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no dime novel or any other kind of a novel to this affair,
      Colonel Ward. I'm not especially fitted to be the hero of a book. Nor to
      be one of your hired men, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye've made up your mind to straddle out your legs and play
      Branscome's mule, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his special characteristic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was drawled coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kicked when ye tried to drive him with a whip and he bit and squealed
      when ye tried to coax him along with sweet apples. So if ye won't neither
      lead nor drive, then out with it man fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply demand my liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what be ye goin' to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my own affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men sat and looked at each other a long time, the old man's choler
      rising the higher from the fact that it had been so long repressed. The
      young man's glance did not fall before this furious regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Ward quivered his fists above his head, stamped around the little
      room and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a few hours to do a little more thinkin' in, and then you look
      out for yourself, for it's up to you, you&mdash;,&rdquo; he slammed and locked
      the door and went away, cursing horribly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ELEVEN&mdash;THE BEAR THAT WALKED LIKE A MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      That in this age of law and order Gideon Ward meditated any actual
      violence to his person Parker found it hard to believe as he sat there in
      the &ldquo;wangan&rdquo; and pondered on his situation. He could not avoid the
      conclusion that at heart Colonel Ward was a coward. But sometimes
      circumstances that a brave man will not suffer to rule him will drive a
      coward into crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long and dreary day for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window he saw Colonel Ward go scurrying away on a jumper,
      evidently bound for the choppings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook and cookee surveyed his prison at a distance. They seemed to have
      no desire to come into close contact with a man of whom they had heard
      such sinister reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackett, who hung about camp, apparently to serve as general &ldquo;striker&rdquo; and
      man of all work, brought food at noon and left it without engaging in
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker made a dull day of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the chill dusk had fallen and he had stuffed his rusty little stove
      with all the wood it would hold, he heard the men returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A colloquy that occurred after supper interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Colonel Ward bellow at some one who was evidently advancing
      toward the wangan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you, Connick, where are you goin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to pass a word with the lad,&rdquo; the man replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got your knittin'?&rdquo; squalled Ward sarcastically. &ldquo;There's no
      call for you to go passin' talk around that wangan camp, Connick. You come
      away from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Connick spoke again it was evident he had not retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only right to let him come into the men's camp for a bit this
      evening, Colonel Ward. There'll be a snatch or so of fiddlin' that he'll
      like, to cheer him up, and a jig and a song or so. I don't see the harm in
      mentionin' it to him, to find if he'd like to come. I'll answer for it
      that he's put back in his nest ag'in all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's runnin' this camp, me or you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the man, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there'll be no invitin' out nor passin' talk. You men have
      nothin' to do with that chap in that wangan and you'll keep away from him
      or get your heads broken open. Do you hear what I say? Why don't you come
      away when I speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not the man to disobey orders,&rdquo; growled Connick. &ldquo;But I'm a man as
      likes man's style. I've always done your biddin', Colonel Ward, and I done
      your biddin' when I brought him here. Now I've found him a lively young
      chap that I'm proud to know and tho I speak for myself alone I speak as a
      man that likes fair play, and I say it's dirty bus'ness keepin' him like a
      chicken in a coop, after you've had your bus'ness talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal bundle of hair and rags, do you dare to stand there and tell
      me how to run my own affairs?&rdquo; roared Ward, thoroughly incensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your bus'ness your own bus'ness for all I care,&rdquo; Connick answered
      angrily. &ldquo;But when it gits to be bus'ness that can't be backed up
      man-fashion then ye may find that day's wages don't buy the whole earth
      for ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was a bit enigmatical but Ward understood that it signified
      mutiny. He gasped a few times and then Parker heard Connick exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ye strike me with that sled-stake, Colonel Gideon, or it might be
      the worse for ye. I'll not bother your man in the wangan till I find out
      more about what you're doin' to him&mdash;but don't you hit me with that
      stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men went back into the big camp, Ward furiously chewing the
      reflection that for the first time he had been bearded in his own camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Ward sat until midnight in his little pen off the main camp, poking
      his fire and meditating. He had reckoned that he was justified in
      proceeding to extremes with this young man, confident that in the end he
      would break his spirit and frighten him out of the woods. But he realized
      now with sinking heart that his violence had endangered all the political
      influence of the gigantic timber interests. The youth had a powerful
      weapon, and he, Gideon Ward, would be accused of furnishing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perspiration dripped from under the old man's cap. He rasped his rough
      palms together nervously. At last he rose and tip-toed into the main camp.
      All the men were asleep, snoring with the lusty heartiness of a tired
      lumber crew. The colonel advanced cautiously to Hackett's bunk, and
      stirred that worthy with his finger until the man awoke. He beckoned, and
      Hackett followed him into the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hackett,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yeh have worked for me a good many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've let yeh have money on a mortgage for one or two little favors yeh've
      done me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hackett began to grow pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I'll lift that whole mortgage for another favor&mdash;an' don't get
      scared. I sha'n't ask yeh to do any more'n I propose to do myself.&rdquo; Ward
      had noted the look of alarm on the man's face. &ldquo;If we're both in it
      neither can say anything. I took yeh along with me last night and to-day
      so's yeh could hear how that young fool insults me on my own land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what he said, colonel, an' no man can blame ye for feelin' put
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ward looked at him steadily for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me. Few words when there's work to do: that's my motto. I've
      done the thinkin' part of this thing. What I want you for is to help on
      the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stared with stupid inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hackett, here's my plan. You and I don't want to hurt that man. We can't
      afford to hurt him. But he's on my hands, an' he won't back down, an' it
      puts me in a hard place&mdash;a mighty hard place, Hackett. You heard what
      passed between us? Now he's got to be put out of this camp an' shoved
      where he can't blab this thing round about. Why, he's half got that fool
      of a Connick on his side already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing, Hackett, is for you to take him across into that
      Tumble-dick camp an' keep him there&mdash;keep him there! Tie him to a
      beam and feed him like yeh would a pup. Keep him there till he weakens an'
      quits, or till I can think up some plan further. It'll give me time,
      Hackett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't any extra sort of job for me, Colonel Ward!&rdquo; grumbled Hackett
      &ldquo;I've got to watch that critter day in an' day out, an' Tumble-dick camp
      is all o' twenty miles from here, or from any other camp, for that
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I want him there, Hackett. We'll tie him on a moose sled, an'
      you start in an hour, whilst the men are still asleep. I'll break a window
      out of the wangan, an' on this crust there'll be no foot-tracks. It'll be
      thought he broke out and ran away&mdash;an' that'll be his own lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice became low and husky. &ldquo;Yeh needn't hitch him too tight in
      Tumble-dick camp, Hackett, providin' you hide the most of his clothes an'
      it looks like a storm comin' on. If he wants to duck out away from a good
      home into the woods, with grub an' fire twenty-five miles away, why,
      that's his own lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man licked his lips nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't our liability, yeh knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's eight hundred for you, Hackett, an' always a good job with me as
      long as I hire men,&rdquo; persisted Colonel Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Hackett got up and struck his elbows against his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it!&rdquo; he grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker's first alarmed awakening was with a cloth about his neck, choking
      him so that his cry of fright rattled in his throat. He fought bravely,
      but two strong men are better than one who has struggled and gasped until
      he has only a trickle of air in his lungs. He was bound, his head muffled
      in a strip of torn blanket, and he was carried out into the night. He
      could not see his captors, but he knew that Ward was one of the
      assailants, because a hoarse command to Hackett had betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had been dragged a distance Parker realized by a penetrating odor
      that he was near the horse hovels. There was a mumbled discussion between
      his captors as to whether he should be tied to the moose sled. It was
      decided that his arms should be left pinioned as they were, and Hackett
      growled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tie him to the sled! I'll be needin' him on the steep pitches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As his arms were tied behind his back, when they put an old fur coat on
      him they pulled the sleeves of it on his legs and buttoned the coat
      behind. In spite of the bandage over his eyes, he easily recognized these
      operations, and then felt himself lifted upon the familiar moose sled.
      Several bags full of something were thrown on. With his ears strained for
      every sound that would give him any information, he heard some one
      approaching even before the two men, busy between camp and sled, were
      warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; grunted the voice of Colonel Ward, at last. &ldquo;Who's that movin'
      round back of the hoss hovel? Look out, Hackett! Throw something acrost
      the sled. He's comin' this way.&rdquo; A moment after, his tones full of
      disgust, he snorted, &ldquo;It's that infernal old moose! Here, hand me that
      ax!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hurry of feet, and then Parker heard the impact of a crushing blow and
      the muffled groan of a stricken animal. The ax blows continued, apparently
      dealt with fury, and in a few moments the old man creaked across the
      crust, dragging some heavy object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your fresh meat, Hackett&mdash;two hind-quarters,&rdquo; he panted.
      &ldquo;Load it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys will be r'iled to find Ben here in the mornin'!&rdquo; whined the
      other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't eat any more grain f'r me!&rdquo; the colonel boomed, wrathfully.
      &ldquo;Then again, it will show that after Mister Railroad Man broke out of the
      wangan camp he killed the moose to get grub to last him for his trip,
      bein' afraid to tackle Gid Ward's camps. The boys will be ready to
      massacree him if they can lay hands on him, but,&rdquo; his tones became
      ominously significant, &ldquo;remember your lines now, man! Get away and I'll
      look after this end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker felt the loaded sled glide over the crust. He could hardly believe
      that these men meditated anything except a change in his place of
      imprisonment; but as the sled moved on and on, and in his helplessness he
      weighed the situation, he began to feel a vague fear of possibilities. He
      began to plan means of escape. When at last the sled went scaling down a
      long slope, he rolled off on the crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lay there, he expected every moment to hear the man shout an oath
      and return. When the hasty creaking of the footsteps died away, he knew
      that the lightened sled, following of its own momentum, had not betrayed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoodwinked and pinioned, it was no easy task to travel among the trees and
      across the slippery crust. As Parker scrambled along, he was tempted to
      cry out and appeal to the man to return. Now that his sudden panic of the
      flitting sled was over, the dull, cold fear of a helpless and abandoned
      man came upon him. But he clinched his teeth to keep back the cry that
      struggled to follow the man of the sled, and kept pushing on into the
      undergrowth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he stopped and began to scrub his forehead against the rough bark
      of a tree, endeavoring to remove the bandage. After a time he worked it
      above his eyes, although it still bound his head like a turban.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see the crisp stars through the interlocking branches. He found
      the pole star. But as he had been unable to guess the direction his captor
      had taken in leaving the camp, the points of the compass mattered little
      in this wilderness, where all was strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker went on, reflecting uneasily that every step might be taking him
      directly back to Colonel Ward's camp. His grotesque garb hampered his
      movements. He lumbered along as awkwardly as a bear. After a time he came
      through some little spruces that whipped his face, and discovered a
      tote-road that had been long abandoned, for the bushes grew in it and the
      crust was unmarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a while. Then he shut his eyes, whirled until he dropped,
      scrambled up, and started away in the direction in which chance had faced
      him. He smiled as he thought upon this childish resource, but in that
      bewildering region he had at least been enabled to make up his mind
      quickly by the device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosy light of the dawn touched him as he plodded along. His advance
      was slow, for the sleeves of the fur coat impeded free use of his legs.
      The day was clear and cold, with a stinging wind that tossed the roaring
      branches of the spruce-trees. The crust held firm. Parker's constrained
      arms were aching and his hands were numb. He jerked and twisted at the
      thongs until his wrists were raw, but the knots were too strong for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had passed so many crossings and fork-ings of the bush-grown road that
      he gave up trying to keep the ramifications in mind for his use should he
      find it necessary to turn back. He now went on doggedly, choosing this way
      or that, as it chanced, hoping to hear a ringing ax or a hunter's gun or a
      teamster's shout somewhere in those solitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon the road led him to an ice-sheathed stream. Here the
      way divided.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the road that led down-stream. It undoubtedly ended at a lake,
      thought he. Log-landings are on lakes. There would be men to release him
      from the torture of aching muscles and gnawing stomach. Parker would have
      welcomed the sight of Colonel Gideon Ward himself when that second night
      came through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was beyond human endurance to walk farther, but Parker realized that if
      he lay down in that state of cold, weariness and hunger he would never
      rise again. He marshaled in his mind all the people, all the interests he
      had to live for; the parents who depended on him, a certain young girl who
      was waiting so anxiously for his return, his prospects in life. He did
      this methodically, as if he were piling fagots for a fire at which to warm
      himself. Then he mentally kindled the heap with the blaze of a mighty
      determination to live, and standing under a great spruce, he began to
      stamp about it and count aloud. Half a dozen times during that long night
      he staggered and fell, as if an invisible hand had struck him down. But
      the next moment, with a cry of &ldquo;I'll stay awake!&rdquo; he was up again and at
      his self-set task, mind, muscles and nerves centering in his one desperate
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dawn came peeping over the big spruces, and found him still at
      his grim gambols. He set forth once more down the road, slipping and
      stumbling, his body doubled forward. A few miles and a few hours more&mdash;it
      was the most he could hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once his dull ears heard the zin-n-ng of a rifle-bullet close to
      his head; and almost immediately, as he ducked and rolled upon his back,
      the sinister shriek of another ball made it plain that he was the game
      aimed at. Two smart cracks at some distance indicated the location of the
      marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animal instinct is alike in brute and man. Parker leaped at the sound of
      the first bullet, fell, and rolled behind a snow-covered boulder. Had Ward
      or his minion tracked him? Were they now carrying out their desperate
      plan? The double report was proof that the man or men were determined on
      slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long time he dared to peer cautiously. At some distance down the
      tote-road an old man was crouching beside a moose sled. On the sled was
      the carcass of a deer. Parker realized that this old man must be a
      poacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      An assassin sent after a man would not be wasting his ammunition on deer
      in close time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man remained motionless, with the stolidity of the veteran hunter
      waiting to make sure. Torpor rapidly seized on Parker's mind. He shouted
      as best he could, but his voice was hoarse from hours of shouting into the
      vastness of the deserted woods. His faculties were growing befogged. He
      dared not exert himself enough to keep awake, for his rock was but a
      narrow bulwark. It seemed to be a choice of deaths, only.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he desperately leaped up and danced behind his protecting boulder,
      uttering such cries as he could. But he saw the old man throw his rifle up
      and take aim. Down he dropped, and the bullet sang overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized then that his garb made him resemble some strange beast&mdash;a
      bear, perhaps&mdash;and he gritted his teeth as he pondered that this
      might be part of Gideon Ward's vindictive scheme. If he attempted to show
      himself long enough to convince the old man that he was human he would
      only be inviting the bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until his blurring senses left him he occasionally shouted or thrust up
      his head; but the old still-hunter was relentless, and evidently had not
      the clear vision of a youth. He was always ready with a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with tears freezing on his cheeks, Parker gave himself up to the
      fatuous comfort of the man succumbing to cold and hunger.

      CHAPTER TWELVE&mdash;THE STRANGE &ldquo;CAT-HERMIT OF MOXIE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Afterward it seemed that he began to dream. Somber individuals were
      crushing his limbs between great rollers. Frisky little ghouls were
      sticking needles into him, and there were so many needles that it seemed
      that every inch of his skin was being tortured at the same instant.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The agony grew intense. He was trying to cry out, and a giant hand was
      over his mouth. And when the pain became so excruciating that it did not
      seem as if nature could longer endure it, he opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sludge-dish hooked to a beam shed its yellow glimmer of light upon a
      strange interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more strange figure in the place than Parker himself. He was
      stripped and seated in a half-hogshead filled with water, from which
      vapors were rising. His first wild thought was that the water was hot and
      was blistering him. He screamed in the agony of alarm and strove to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hands on his shoulders forced him down again. These hands were rubbing
      snow upon him. Then the young man realized that his sensations were
      produced by icy cold water. Parker felt that cloths bound snow and ice to
      his ears and face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance showed him that he was in a rude log camp. The chinked walls were
      bare and solid. The interior was spacious, and a big fireplace promised
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most astonishing of all in the place were its visible tenants&mdash;a
      multitude of cats. Some were huddled on benches, their assorted colors and
      markings composing a strange medley. Others stalked about the cabin. Many
      sat before the embers in the fireplace. A half-score were grouped about
      the hogshead and its occupant, with their tails wound round their feet,
      and were solemnly observing the work of reanimating the stranger. Here and
      there among taciturn felines of larger growth little spike-tail kits were
      rolling, cuffing, frolicking and miauing. For a moment the scene seemed a
      part of his delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker turned round to survey his benefactor. He found him to be an old
      man, shaggy of beard and hair. A pointed cap of fur covered his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed in rough garb&mdash;belted woolen jacket, trousers
      awkwardly patched, leggings rolled above the knee, and yellow moccasins.
      Although he was the ordinary type of the woods recluse, there was
      kindliness in his expression, as well as a benignant gleam in his eye that
      was not usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'ye feel?&rdquo; he asked, solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I were being pounded with mallets and torn by pincers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all over!&rdquo; snapped Parker, rather ungraciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; drawled the old man, rubbing more snow briskly on the
      aching flesh. &ldquo;I guess I'm goin' to save ye, down to the last toe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If aches will do it I'm saved!&rdquo; groaned the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't 'a' gi' a copper cent for ye when I got ye here to camp,&rdquo; the
      old man proceeded, &ldquo;but I've done the very best I could, mister, to fetch
      ye round. I hope ye ain't a-goin' to complain on me,&rdquo; he added, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complain on you?&rdquo; Parker demanded. &ldquo;Do you think I owe myself a grudge
      for coming back to life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to ask ye a fair question,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll answer any questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ye a game-warden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The honest ring of that negative was unmistakable. The old man sighed with
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I found ye done up in that co't I thought ye was a game-warden,
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Parker demanded, with asperity, &ldquo;did you sit there and blaze
      away at me with any suspicion that I was a human being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land bless ye, no!&rdquo; cried the old man, with a shocked sincerity there was
      no doubting. &ldquo;I never harmed any one in all my life. But I was feelin' so
      good over savin' ye that I had to have my little joke. I was out this
      mornin' as us'al, after meat for my cats. I have to work hard to keep 'em
      in meat, mister. I can't stand round and see my kitties starve&mdash;no,
      s'r! Wal, I was out after meat, an' was takin' home a deer when I see what
      any man, even with better eyesight than mine, would have called a brown
      bear trodgin' round a tree an' sharp'nin' his claws. What he was up to out
      of his den in such weather I didn't know, but of course I fired, an' I
      kept firin'. An' when at last I fired an' he didn't bob out any more, I
      crept up an' took a look. I thought I'd faint when I see what I see&mdash;a
      man in a buffl'ler co't wrong side to an' his head all tied up an' his
      arms fastened behind him. Land, if it didn't give me a start! Wal, I left
      my deer right there an' h'isted ye on my sled, and struck across Little
      Moxie for my camp here on the double-quick, now I can tell ye. Ye was
      froze harder'n a doorknob, but I guess I'm goin' to have ye out all
      complete. Lemme see your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carefully undid the cloths, to an accompaniment of groans from Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're red's pinys. No need to worry one mite, mister. Come out o' your
      water whilst I rub ye down. Then to bed with a cup o' hot tea, and hooray
      for Doctor Joshua Ward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known you were Joshua Ward when I noticed all those cats,&rdquo;
       said Parker. So this was Colonel Gideon's brother! He was too weak and ill
      to feel or display much surprise at the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most every one hereabouts has heard o' me,&rdquo; the old man admitted, mildly.
      &ldquo;Some men have fast hosses, some men have big liberies, some men like to
      spend their money on paintin's an' statues. But for me, I like cats, even
      if they do keep me running my legs off after meat. Hey, pussy?&rdquo; and he
      stooped and stroked the head of a huge cat that arched its back and leaned
      against his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Joshua Ward,&rdquo; said Parker, grimly, &ldquo;you'd probably like to know how I
      happened to be prowling round through the forest dressed up so as to play
      bear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meditatin' that ye'd tell me by n' by, if it wa'n't any secret,&rdquo;
       the old man replied, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you have a right to know. You possess a personal interest
      in the matter, Mr. Ward. I was tied up and sent away to be killed or to be
      turned out to die by a man named Colonel Gideon Ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Parker's surprise the old man did not stop in his rubbing, but said,
      plaintively, &ldquo;I was almost afeard it might be some o' Gid's works, or, to
      say the least his puttin' up. He don't improve any as he grows older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have pretty good reason to know how much chance there is for
      improvement in Gideon Ward,&rdquo; suggested Parker, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fam'ly matters, fam'ly matters, young man,&rdquo; murmured Joshua, reprovingly.
      &ldquo;But I ain't tryin' to excuse Brother Gideon, ye understand. I'm afeard
      that when the time of trial does come to him, he will find that the hand
      of the Lord is heavy in punishment. I've had a good part of a lifetime,
      young man, to think all these things over in this place up here. A man
      gets near to God in these woods. A man can put away the little thoughts.
      The warm sun thaws his hate; the big winds blow out the flame of anger;
      the great trees sing only one song, and high or low, it's 'Hush&mdash;hush-h-h&mdash;hush-h-h-h!'&rdquo;
       The voice of the man softly imitated the soughing of the pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker stumbled to his bunk, his feet still uncertain, drank his tea, and
      slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, after the breakfast of bread and venison, the host said:
      &ldquo;Young man, now that you have slept on your anger, I wish you'd tell me
      the story of your trouble with my brother Gideon. I know that he has been
      rough and hard with men, but many have been rough and hard with him. This
      is a country where all the men are rough and hard. But I fear that had it
      not been for the good God and these old hands of mine, my brother would be
      now little else than a murderer. Tell me the story.&rdquo; His voice trembled
      with apology and apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker stated all the circumstances faithfully and impartially. At the
      conclusion Joshua's eyes glowed with fires that had not been seen in them
      for years. He struck his brown fist down on his rude table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defying God's law and man's law to the disgrace of himself and all his
      name! And you had not been rough and hard to him,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Bitter,
      bitter news you bring to me, Mr. Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, and at last Joshua Ward went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker, that man is my own&mdash;my only brother, no matter how other
      people look at him. I have saved your life. Will you give me one chance to
      straighten this matter out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that if Gideon Ward will pay for the damage he has done your
      property, ask your forgiveness as a man, and promise to keep away and let
      you alone, will you be charitable enough to let the matter rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker pondered a while with set lips. It cost a struggle to forego
      vengeance on that wretch, but many issues were involved, principally the
      early completion of the railroad and his consequent favor with his
      employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ward,&rdquo; he declared, at last, &ldquo;I came down here to build a railroad,
      not to get entangled in the courts. For your sake and the sake of my
      project I will give your brother an opportunity to make atonement on the
      conditions you name. I owe my life to you, and I will discharge part of my
      obligation in the way you ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid to accompany me back to Number 7 camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; In his turn Parker struck the table. &ldquo;I am ready to go back
      there alone and charge that man with his crime, and depend on the manhood
      of his crew to stand neutral while I take him and deliver him over to the
      law. And that I will do if you fail in your endeavors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was silent. He made no attempt to soften the young man's
      indignation or resolution. Parker noted that his lips tightened as tho
      with solemn, inward resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remainder of his convalescing stay in the camp the subject of
      Gideon Ward was not broached again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit beguiled the hours with simple narratives of the woods, his
      cats on knees and shoulders. He had no complaints for the past or the
      present and no misgivings as to the future, so it appeared from his talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker came to realize that under his peculiar and, to the casual
      observer, erratic mode of life there was a calm and sound philosophy that
      he had cultivated in his retirement. He had the strange notions of those
      who have lived much alone and in the wilderness. An unkind critic would
      have dismissed him brusquely with the belief that his troubles had
      unbalanced his mind. But Parker saw beneath all his eccentricity, and as
      the hermit wistfully discoursed of the peace that the woods had given him
      the young man conceived both respect and affection for this strange
      character. His knowledge of Joshua's life tragedy pre-disposed him to
      pity. He was grateful for the tender solicitude the old man had shown
      toward him. At the end of his stay he sincerely loved the brother of his
      enemy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTEEN&mdash;THE BEAR OF THE BIG WOODS &ldquo;BAITED&rdquo; AFTER HIS OWN
      FASHION
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the third morning Parker was able to travel. Joshua Ward had brought
      the carcass of the slain deer across the lake on his sled, and the cats of
      Little Moxie were left to rule the island and feast at will until the
      return of the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day they set forth it was shortly after dark,&mdash;for they had
      proceeded slowly on account of the young man's feet, when Parker again
      looked down from the ridge upon Number 7 camp. If Colonel Gideon Ward was
      not there, they proposed to follow along his line of camps until they
      found him. Parker carried a shotgun with two barrels. The old man bore his
      rifle. They advanced without hesitation over the creaking snow, straight
      to the door of the main camp, and entered after the unceremonious fashion
      of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred men were ranged on the long benches called &ldquo;deacons' seats,&rdquo; or
      lounged on the springy browse in their bunks. A man, with one leg crossed
      over his knee, and flapping it to beat his time, was squawking a lively
      tune on a fiddle, and a perspiring youth danced a jig on a square of
      planking before the roaring fire. The air was dim with the smoke of many
      pipes and with the steam from drying garments hung on long poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connick removed his pipe when the door opened, and gazed under his hand,
      held edgewise to his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hello, my bantam boy!&rdquo; he bawled, in greeting. &ldquo;What did you break
      out o' the wangan and run away for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fiddle stopped. The men crowded up from the bunks and deacons' seats.
      All were as curious as magpies. They gazed with interest on Parker's
      companion. But no one threatened them by look or gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Gideon Ward here?&rdquo; inquired Joshua, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm here!&rdquo; came the answer, shouted from the pen at the farther end.
      &ldquo;What's wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Joshua!&rdquo; called the brother. &ldquo;I'll come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; cried Gideon; and the next moment he came
      shouldering through the men, who fell back to let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant his keen gaze fell on the person who bore his brother company
      he seemed to understand the situation perfectly. There was just the
      suspicion of fear when he faced the blazing eyes of Parker, but he snorted
      contemptuously and turned to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Josh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;out with it! What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter isn't one to be talked over in public, brother,&rdquo; suggested
      Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't any secrets in my life!&rdquo; shouted Gideon, defiantly, as if he
      proposed to anticipate and discount any allegations that his visitors
      might produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye don't refuse to let me talk a matter of business over with ye in
      private, do ye, Gideon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ward,&rdquo; said Parker, stepping forward, &ldquo;your brother is ashamed to
      show you up before these men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Connick, Hackett, any of you! Seize that runaway, and throw him
      into the wangan till I get ready to attend to him!&rdquo; commanded Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I tell ye!&rdquo; bawled the colonel. &ldquo;Twenty dollars to the men&mdash;fifty
      dollars to the men who ketch an' tie him for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several rough-looking fellows came elbowing forward, tempted by the
      reward. Parker raised his gun, but Connick was even quicker. The giant
      seized an ax, and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep back, all of ye! There's goin' to be fair play here to-night, an'
      it's Dan Connick says so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connick,&rdquo; Gideon's command was almost a scream, &ldquo;don't you interfere in
      what's none o' your business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my business when a square man don't get his rights,&rdquo; Connick cried,
      with fully as much energy as the colonel, &ldquo;and that chap is a man, for he
      licked me clean and honest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur almost like applause went through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; broke in Parker, &ldquo;I cannot expect to have friends here, and you may
      all be enemies, but I have come back, knowing that woodsmen are on the
      side of grit and fair dealing. Listen to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In college Parker had been class orator and a debater of power. Now he
      stood on a block of wood, and gazed upon a hundred bearded faces, on which
      the flickering firelight played eerily. In the hush he could hear the big
      winds wailing through the trees outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward stood in advance of the rest, his mighty fists clinched, his face
      quivering and puckering in his passion. As the young man began to speak,
      he attempted to bellow him into silence. But Connick strode forward, put
      his massive hands on Gideon's shoulders, and thrust him down upon a
      near-by seat. The big woodsman, his rebellion once started, seemed to
      exult in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the by-laws of this ly-cee-um is that the meetin' sha'n't be
      disturbed!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Colonel Gid Ward, ye will kindly listen to this
      speech for the good of the order or I'll gag ye! You've had a good many
      years to talk to us in and you've done it. Go ahead, young man! You've got
      the floor an' Dan Connick's in the chair.&rdquo; He rolled his sleeves above his
      elbows and gazed truculently on the assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your brother's sake,&rdquo; cried the young engineer, &ldquo;I offer you one more
      chance to listen to reason, Colonel Gideon Ward! Do you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the infuriated shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen to the story of a scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/246.jpg" alt="Listen to the Story of a Scoundrel 216-246 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The men did listen, for Parker spoke with all the eloquence that
      indignation and honest sentiment could inspire. He first told the story of
      the wrecked life of the brother, and pointed to the bent figure of the
      hermit of Little Moxie, standing in the shadows. Once or twice Joshua
      lifted his quavering voice in feeble protest, but the ringing tones of the
      young man overbore his halting speech. Several times Connick was obliged
      to force the colonel back on the deacons' seat, each time with more
      ferocity of mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Parker came to his own ambitions to carry out the orders of his
      employers. He explained the legal status of the affair, and passed quickly
      on to the exciting events of the night on which he had been bound and sent
      upon his ride into the forest, to meet some fate, he knew not what. He
      described the brutal slaughter of the moose, and the immediate
      dismemberment of the animal. He noticed with interest that many men who
      had displayed no emotion as he described poor old Joshua's sufferings now
      grunted angrily at hearing the revelation concerning the fate of Ben, the
      camp mascot. This dramatic explanation of Ward's furious cruelty to the
      poor beast proved, curiously enough, the turning point in Parker's favor,
      even with the roughest of the crew. Then Parker described how he had been
      rescued and brought back to life by the old man whom Gideon Ward had so
      abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my men,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I am come back among you; and I ask you
      all to stand back, so that it may now be man to man&mdash;so that I may
      take this brutal tyrant who has abused us all, and deliver him over to the
      law that is waiting to punish him as he deserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped down, seized a halter, and advanced with the apparent intention
      of seizing and binding the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye goin' to stand here, ye hunderd cowards, an' see the man that
      gives ye your livin' lugged away to jail?&rdquo; Gideon shouted, retreating. He
      glared on their faces. The men turned their backs and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crouched almost to the floor, brandishing his fists above his head.
      &ldquo;I've got ten camps in this section,&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;an' any one of them
      will back me aginst the whole United States army if I ask 'em to! They
      ain't the cowards that I've got here. I'll come back here an' pay ye off
      for this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before any one could stop him, for the men had left him standing alone, he
      precipitated his body through the panes of glass of the nearest window,
      and almost before the crash had ceased he was making away into the night
      Connick led the rush of men to the narrow door, but the mob was held them
      for a few precious moments, fighting with one another for egress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don't catch him,&rdquo; the foreman roared, &ldquo;he'll be back on us with an
      army of cut-throats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the crew went streaming forth at last, Colonel Ward was out of
      sight in the forest. Lanterns were brought, and the search prosecuted
      earnestly, but his moccasined feet were not to be traced on the frozen
      crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chase was abandoned after an hour, for the clouds that had hung heavy
      all day long began to sift down snow; and soon a blizzard howled through
      the threshing spruces and hemlocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's six miles to the nearest camp,&rdquo; said Connick, when the crew was
      again assembled at Number 7, &ldquo;an' in order to dodge us he prob'ly kept out
      of the tote-road. I should say that the chances of Gid Ward's ever
      get-tin' out o' the woods alive in this storm wa'n't worth that!&rdquo; He
      snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not right for us to come back here an' leave him out there!&rdquo; cried
      the brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took his chances,&rdquo; the foreman replied, &ldquo;when he went through that
      window. There's a good many reasons why I'd like to see him back here, Mr.
      Ward, but I'm sorry to have to tell ye, ye bein' a brother of his, that
      love ain't one o' them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go alone, then,&rdquo; said the old man, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brotherly love is worth respect, Mr. Ward,&rdquo; Connick declared, &ldquo;but I
      ain't the kind of man that stands idle an' sees suicide committed. Ye've
      done your full duty by your brother. Now I'm goin' to do my duty by you.
      You don't go through that door till this storm is over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the wind raged on and the snow piled its drifts. Joshua Ward
      sat silent by the fire, his head in his hands, or stood in the &ldquo;dingle,&rdquo;
       gazing mournfully out into the smother of snowflakes. It would be a mad
      undertaking to venture abroad. He realized it and needed no further
      restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dawn of the third day was crisp and bright. Soon after sunrise a
      panting woodsman, traveling at his top speed on snow-shoes, halted for a
      hasty bite at Number 7. He was a messenger from the camp above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Gid Ward was picked up yesterday froze pretty nigh solid!&rdquo; he
      gulped out, between his mouthfuls. &ldquo;I'm goin' down for a doctor,&rdquo; and then
      he went striding away, even as Joshua Ward took the up-trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker spent all that day in sober thought, and then, forming his
      resolution, took passage on the first tote-team that went floundering
      through toward Sunkhaze. His departure was neither hindered nor
      encouraged.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOURTEEN&mdash;HOW RODNEY PARKER PAID AN HONEST DEBT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The engineer found his little garrison holding the fort at the Poquette
      Carry camp&mdash;and confining their attentions wholly to holding the
      fort. Not an ax blow had been struck since his hurried departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't work no more,&rdquo; explained one of the men, &ldquo;because we'd give up
      all idea of seein you ag'in. Of course we reckoned that a new boss would
      prob'ly be comin' along pretty quick and we thought we'd wait and find out
      just what he wanted us to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it will be the same old boss and the same old plan,&rdquo; replied Parker
      curtly. The idea that the men had considered him such easy prey made him
      indignant. &ldquo;You'll consider after this that I'm the Colonel Gideon Ward of
      this six-mile stretch here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon there won't be any real Gid Ward any more,&rdquo; said the man.
      &ldquo;Feller went through here last night, hi-larrup for 'lection, to git a doc
      for Gid. Seems he got caught out and froze up somehow&mdash;tho I never
      s'picioned that weather would have any effect on the old sanup. P'rhaps
      you've been hearin' all about how it happened? Feller wouldn't stop long
      enough to explain to us.&rdquo; The man's gaze was full of inquisitiveness and
      the others crowded around to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with self-repression truly admirable Parker told them that he had no
      news to give out concerning Colonel Ward, of any nature whatsoever. He
      ordered the driver of the tote-team to whip up and rode away toward
      Sunkhaze, leaving the men gaping after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed the same reticence at the settlement, tho he was received with
      a demonstration that was something like an ovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his better sense told him that the men were justified in
      preserving neutrality at the time of the raid, yet he could not rid
      himself of the very human feeling of resentment because they had
      surrendered him so readily into the hands of his adversaries. But the
      chief influence that prompted silence was the fear lest details of his
      mishap and the reasons therefor would get into the newspapers to the
      annoyance of his employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am back and the work is going on just as tho nothing had happened,&rdquo; he
      said to the men who crowded into the office of the tavern to congratulate
      him. &ldquo;Matters have been straightened out and the less talk that's made the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the postmaster, presuming on more intimate acquaintance, followed him
      up to his room, where his effects had been carefully preserved for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned you'd get back some time,&rdquo; said Dodge. &ldquo;I've predicted that
      much. But, I swanny, I didn't look for you to come back with your tail
      over the dasher, as you've done. That is, I didn't look for you to come
      that way not until that feller blew in here to telegraft for a doctor for
      old Gid. Then I see that it was him that was got done up instead of you.
      But speakin' of telegraftin', there ain't no word gone out from here as
      yit about the hoorah&mdash;not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that Sunkhaze has kept the Swamp Swogon affair and my
      kidnapping quiet?&rdquo; demanded Parker, his face lighting up. He had been
      fearing what might have gone out to the world about the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many was all of a to-do to telegraft it to the sheriff and to your
      bosses,&rdquo; said the postmaster calmly. &ldquo;But it seemed better to me to wait a
      while. I says, 'Look here, neighbors, it's goin' to be some time before
      the sheriff can git his crowd together and git at Ward&mdash;and even then
      there'll be politics to consider. The sheriff won't move anyway till he
      gits the word of the Lumbermen's Association. And it'll probably happen by
      that time that the young man will show up here again. All we'll git out of
      it hereabouts is a black eye in the newspapers&mdash;it bein' held up that
      Sunkhaze ain't a safe place to settle in. And all that truck&mdash;you
      know! Furthermore, from things you've dropped to me, Mr. Parker, I knew
      you were playin' kind of a lone hand and a quiet game here. My old father
      used to say, 'Run hard when you run, but don't start so sudden that you
      stub your toe and tumble down.' So in your case I just took the
      responsibility and held the thing back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster's eyes were searching Parker's face for signal of
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer went to him and shook his hand with hearty emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a level head, Mr. Postmaster,&rdquo; he said, delightedly. &ldquo;We'll
      start exactly where we left off and so far as I am concerned the place
      will never get a bad name from me. In return for your frankness and your
      service to me, I'll give you a hint as to what happened to Colonel Ward. I
      know you won't abuse my confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, the postmaster said earnestly, &ldquo;Mr. Parker, however
      much old Gid Ward owes you, you owe Josh Ward a good deal more. He ain't a
      man to dun for his pay. But if he ever does ask you to square the account
      you won't be the man I take you for if you don't settle. If you feel that
      you owe me anything for the little service I've done you and your
      bus'ness, just take and add it to the Josh Ward account. Of all the men on
      earth I pity that man the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in Dodge's eyes when he stumbled down the tavern stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cheerful moment for Parker had been when the postmaster informed him
      of Sunkhaze's equilibrium in the matter of news-monging But a more
      cheerful moment was when Mank, his foreman, standing with him on the ice
      above the submerged Swogon told him that a sandbar made out into the lake
      at that point and that the locomotive was probably lodged on the bar, only
      a little way below the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had sawed the ice and sounded they found this to be true. As
      soon as a broad square of ice had been removed they saw her, all her
      outlines clear against the white sand. The sunken sleds were equally in
      evidence. It was not a diver's job, then, as Parker, in his worryings, had
      feared. On the thick ice surrounding the whole there was solid foothold
      for the raising apparatus and Parker's crew set at work with good cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold, wet and tedious job, the grappling and the raising, but his
      derricks were strong and his rigging plentiful. Moreover, the water was
      not deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the material that could not be recovered by the grapples was
      duplicated by means of quick replies to wired orders, and the work of
      transportation across the lake was successfully completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well into a warm May, and his men for the last week had been moving
      soil and building culverts before the case of Col. Gideon Ward was brought
      to Parker's attention in a manner requiring action. One evening just after
      dusk his foreman scratched on the flap of the engineer's tent, in which he
      was now living at Poquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canvas was lifted and a man entered. Parker turned the reflector of
      his lantern on the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joshua Ward!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he started up and seized the old man's
      outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led him to a camp-stool. They looked at each other for a time in
      silence. Tears trembled on Joshua's eyelashes, and he passed his knotted
      hand over his face before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker,&rdquo; he said, tremulously, &ldquo;I've come to bring ye money to pay
      for every cent's worth o' damage to property 'an loss o' time an'
      everything.&rdquo; He laid a package in the young man's hand. &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo;
       he quavered. &ldquo;I'm goin' to trust to your honesty, for I'm certain I can.
      Take what's right. Gid and I don't know anythin' about railroads an' what
      such things as you lost are worth. All we can do is to show that we mean
      to square things the best we can now. Gid's sorry now, Mr. Parker, he's
      sorry&mdash;sorry&mdash;sorry&mdash;poor Gid!&rdquo; The old man sobbed
      outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he&mdash;&rdquo; The young man paused, half-fearing to ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua again ran his rough palm across his eyes. Then, in dumb grief, he
      set the edge of his right hand against his left wrist, the left hand to
      the right wrist, and then marked a place on each leg above the ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All off there, Mr. Parker.&rdquo; The old man bent his head into his hollowed
      palms. Tears trickled through his fingers. There was a long silence. The
      young man did not know how to interrupt that pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm feedin' an' tendin' him like I used to when he was a baby an' I a
      six-year-old. He's at my camp, Mr. Parker. He don't ever want to be seen
      agin in the world, he says&mdash;only an old, trimmed, dead tree, he says.
      Poor old Gid! No matter what he's been, no matter what he's done, you'd
      pity him now, Mr. Parker, for the hand o' punishment has fell heavy on my
      poor brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, truly shocked, stood beside Joshua, and placed his hand on
      the bowed shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ward,&rdquo; he said, with a quiver in his voice, &ldquo;never will I do anything
      to add one drop to the bitterness in the cup that has come to you and
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Gid, I told Gid,&rdquo; cried the old man, &ldquo;that you'd say somethin'
      like that! I had to comfort him, you know, Mr. Parker; but I felt that
      you, bein' a young man, couldn't make it too hard for us old men. He ain't
      the same Gid now. See here, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With tremulous hands he drew a paper from his pocket and handed it to
      Parker. It was a writing giving sole power of attorney to Joshua Ward. The
      old man pointed to a witnessed scrawl&mdash;a shapeless hieroglyph at the
      bottom of the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gid's mark!&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;No hands&mdash;no hands any more! I feed him, I
      tend him like I would a baby, an' the only words he says to me now are
      pleasant an' brotherly words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' more'n that, Mr. Parker, I'm on my way down to town. I've got some
      errands that are sweet to do&mdash;sweet an' bitter, too. There's new
      fires been lit in the dark corners of my poor brother's heart. I've got
      here a list of the men that Gideon Ward hain't done right by in this life,&mdash;that
      he's cheated,&mdash;an' a list of the widows of the men he hain't done
      right by, an' by that power of attorney he's given me the means, an' he
      says to me to make it square with them people if it takes every cent he's
      worth. It won't cost much for me an' Gid to live at Little Moxie, Mr.
      Parker&mdash;an' poor Cynthy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked into vacancy a while and was silent. Then he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have our last days together, me an' Gid. All these years that I've
      lived alone up there the trees an' the winds an' the skies an' the waves
      of the lake have been sayin' good things to me. I told Gid about them
      voices. He has been too busy all his life to listen before now. But
      sittin' there in these days&mdash;sit-tin' there, always a-sittin' there,
      Mr. Parker! Nothing to do but bend his ear to catch the whispers that come
      up out o' the great, deep lungs o' the universe! He has been listenin',
      an'&rdquo;&mdash;the old man rose and shook the papers above the head of the
      engineer&mdash;&ldquo;God an' the woods have been talkin' the truth to my poor
      brother Gideon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man slept that night in Parker's tent and went on his way at
      morning light, and tho the engineer pressed back again into his hands,
      unopened, the packet that was proffered, and assured him that no harm
      should befall Gideon Ward through complaint or report for which he was
      responsible, Parker still felt that somehow there was a balance due old
      Joshua Ward on their books of tacit partnership in well-doing;&mdash;such
      was the honest faith, and patient self-abnegation of the good old man, who
      had endured so much for others' sake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIFTEEN&mdash;THE DAY WHEN POQUETTE BURST WIDE OPEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the spring and the early summer Poquette Carry was an animated
      theater of action. Woodsmen, went up and woodsmen came down, and mingled
      with the busy railroad crews. All examined the progress of construction
      with curiosity, and passed on, uttering picturesque comment. Strange old
      men came paddling down West Branch from unknown wildernesses, and trudged
      their moccasined way from end to end of the line, as if to convince
      themselves that Colonel Gideon Ward really had been conquered on his own
      ground. Newspaper reporters came from the nearest city, and pressed
      Engineer Parker to make a statement &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh,
      &ldquo;not a word for print from me. I was sent here to build this bit of a
      railroad quietly and unobtrusively. Circumstances have paraded our affairs
      before the public in some measure. Now if you quote me, or twist anything
      I may say into an interview, my employers will have good reason to be
      disgusted with me, as well as with the situation here. Furthermore, there
      are personal reasons why I do not wish to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Parker's eager appeal had effect upon the reporters, or whether
      the timber barons influenced the editors, the whole affair of the sunken
      engine was lightly passed over as the prank of roistering woodsmen, and
      Colonel Ward was left wholly undisturbed in his retreat. Even the calamity
      that had befallen him was not mentioned except by word of mouth among the
      woodsmen of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      With self-restraint that is rare in young men, Parker still refused to
      talk about the matter even in Sunkhaze. When he first returned, a sense of
      chagrin at his discomfiture along with reasons that have been mentioned
      kept him silent, it is true, but now, with complete victory in his hands,
      he was sincerely affected by the misfortune that had overtaken his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Swamp Swogon,&rdquo; now that it was running on its own rails and was
      hauling building materials along the crooked railroad, was renicknamed
      &ldquo;The Stump Dodger.&rdquo; Parker's chief pride in the road was necessarily based
      on the fact that it had been constructed without exceeding the
      appropriation, a fact that excused many curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in June the last rails were laid and the ballasting, such as it was,
      was well under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;terminal stations,&rdquo; as the engineer jocosely called them, were neat
      little structures of logs, and there was a log roundhouse, where the Stump
      Dodger retired in smutty and smoky seclusion when its day's toil was
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the engineer prepared for the day of opening, and requested the state
      railroad commissioners to make their final inspection of the road. The
      three officials gravely travelled from end to end of the line in the
      secondhand P. K. &amp; R. coach, the only passenger-car of the road, and
      after some jocular remarks, issued a certificate empowering the Poquette
      Carry Road to convey passengers and collect fares. Then, after a
      telegraphic conference with his employers, Parker announced the day for
      the formal opening of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he had not intended to make any event of this. His idea had been
      that, after the commissioners authorized traffic, he would merely arrange
      a time-table instead of the irregular service of the construction days,
      and would start his trains, observing the care that had been promised in
      seasons of drought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his foreman of construction&mdash;none other than Big Dan Connick, who
      had chosen railroad work under Parker instead of the usual summer labor on
      the drive&mdash;came to him at the head of a group of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Parker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we represent the men who have been building this
      road. We represent also our old friends of the West Branch drivin' crew of
      a hundred men, who are twenty miles up-river and are hankerin' for a
      celebration. We represent all the guides between Sunkhaze and Chamberlain,
      and every man of 'em is glad that this carry has been opened up. The whole
      crowd respectfully insists that seein' as how this is our first woods
      railroad up here, it's proper to have a celebration. If ye don't have the
      official opening we shall take it as meanin' we ain't worth noticin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no denying such earnestness as that nor gainsaying the propriety
      of the demand. Parker made his principals understand the situation. And
      the result was that they themselves set the opening date, and promised to
      be on hand with a party of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rolling-stock of the Poquette Railroad consisted of the Stump Dodger,
      four flat cars designed especially for the transportation of canoes and
      bateaux, three box cars for camp supplies and general freight, and the
      coach transplanted from the P. K. &amp; R. narrow-gage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker announced that on the opening day no fares would be collected, that
      the train would make hourly trips, and that all might ride who could get
      aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to be outdone in generosity, the crew through big Dan Connick,
      declaring that they proposed to make all the preparations for the
      celebration free of charge&mdash;that is, they would accept no wages for
      their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      They built benches on the platform cars and fitted up the box cars in
      similar fashion. They trimmed the Stump Dodger with spruce fronds till the
      locomotive looked like a moving wood-lot. Every flag in Sunkhaze was
      borrowed for the decoration of the coach, and then, in a final burst of
      enthusiasm, the men subscribed a sum sufficient to hire the best brass
      band in that part of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took us some little time to wake up enough to know how much we needed
      a railroad acrost here,&rdquo; said Dan, &ldquo;but now that we're awake we propose to
      let folks know it. Them whose hearin' is sensitive had better take to the
      tall timber that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker met his party at Sunkhaze station on the morning of the great
      occasion. They came in the P. K. &amp; R. president's private car, that
      was run upon a siding to remain during the week the railroad men
      entertained their friends at their new Kennemagon Lake camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; said Parker, as the little steamer puffed across sunlit
      Spinnaker toward Poquette, &ldquo;that the men have arranged a rather rugged
      celebration for to-day; but I know them well, gentlemen, and I want to
      assure you that all they do is meant in the best spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the steamer approached the wharf, tooting its whistle, there was an
      explosion ashore that made the little craft appear to hop out of the
      water. All the anvils of the construction crew had been stuffed with
      powder, and all were fired simultaneously with a battery current!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a yell the shore crowd rushed to the side of the steamer. Dan was
      leading, his broad face glowing with good humor. Groups of cheering men
      clutched the squirming, protesting railroad owners and their friends, and
      bore them on sturdy shoulders to the waiting train. The band from its
      station on a platform car boomed &ldquo;Hail to the Chief,&rdquo; the engine whistle
      screaming an obligato.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the men swarmed upon the cars, crowding every corner, occupying every
      foothold&mdash;but with the thoughtful deference of the woods not
      venturing to encroach upon the privacy of the coach after they had
      deposited their guests there.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the &ldquo;half-way horseback,&rdquo; so-called, Parker ordered the train halted,
      for he wished to show Mr. Jerrard an experiment in culvert construction,
      in which he took an originator's pride. The band kept on playing and the
      men roared choruses.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the young engineer had bellowed his explanation in Jerrard's ear,
      and Jerrard had howled back some warm compliments, striving to make
      himself heard above the uproar, the two climbed the embankment and
      approached the coach. The band was quiet now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speech!&rdquo; cried some one, as Jerrard mounted the steps. He smiled and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speech! Speech!&rdquo; The manager turned to enter his car, still smiling,
      tolerant but disregarding. At a sudden command from Connick, men reached
      out on both sides of the train and clutched the branches of sturdy
      undergrowth that the haste of the construction work had not permitted the
      crews to clear entirely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang on, my hearties!&rdquo; shouted Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker, when he mounted the steps, had given the signal to start, but when
      the engineer opened his throttle, the wheels of the little engine whirled
      in a vain attempt at progress. With a grade, a heavy load, and the
      determined grip of all these brawny hands to contend against, the panting
      Stump Dodger was beaten. Sparks streamed and the smokestack quivered, but
      the train did not start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speech! Speech!&rdquo; the men howled. &ldquo;We won't let go till we hear a speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Entreaties had no effect. First Jerrard, then Whittaker, then Parker, and
      after them all the guests were compelled to come out on the car platform
      and satisfy the truly American passion for a speech. And not until the
      last man had responded did the woodsmen release their hold on the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever heard of a railroad being formally opened and dedicated without
      speeches?&rdquo; cried Connick, as he gave the word to let go. &ldquo;We know the
      style, an' we want everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guides served a lunch at the West Branch end of the line that
      afternoon, and while the railroad party was lounging in happy restfulness
      awaiting the repast, a big bateau came sweeping down the river, driven by
      a half dozen oarsmen. Several passengers disembarked at the end of the
      carry road, and were received respectfully yet uproariously by the
      woodsmen who had just arrived in a fresh train-load from the Spinnaker
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connick came elbowing through the press that surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Shayne,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;she's come, after all, hasn't she? Are you and
      your friends goin' to ride back on her across the carry? I tell you she
      beats a buckboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man whom he addressed smiled with some constraint, and exchanged
      glances with his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we'll stick to our own tote-team as usual, Connick,&rdquo; said another
      in the party, jerking his thumb at the muddy buckboard that was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh say, now, ye've got to meet these here railroad fellers. They're your
      style&mdash;all business!&rdquo; bawled Connick. &ldquo;We ain't fit to entertain 'em
      up here, but you rich fellers are. Just come along. They'll be glad to see
      you. Bring 'em along, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd obediently hustled the new arrivals toward Whittaker and his
      friends, disregarding the surly protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's some of the kings of the spruce country, gentlemen!&rdquo; big Dan
      cried, by way of introduction. &ldquo;Here's Mr. Shayne, the great timber
      operator on the Seboois waters. Here's Mr. Barber of the Upper
      Chamberlain, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several of the new arrivals began to deprecate this unceremonious manner
      of introduction, but the railroad men, recognizing their peers in the
      business world in these sturdy land barons, came forward with a hearty
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the timber kings were eating lunch, although with some
      embarrassment. Occasionally they eyed the railroad men, wondering if the
      memory of the stubborn legislative battle still lingered. But the railroad
      men constantly grew more affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Whittaker, at last, &ldquo;we are not affected in this case by
      any interstate commerce regulations. Therefore, on behalf of myself and my
      associates, I should like to tender you annual passes over our new road.
      Of course the courtesy is a trifling one, but it will indicate that we
      shall appreciate your cooperation in turning your freight business our
      way. We'll save you at least two-thirds of the expense on the haul across
      Poquette.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER SIXTEEN&mdash;THE PACT THAT OPENED RODNEY PARKER'S PROFESSIONAL
      FUTURE
    </h2>

      When one understood all that had gone before, the moment was an electric
      one for the future of the Poquette region.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this apparently trivial offer the railroad king had formally offered
      the olive branch. He gazed at the lumber barons eagerly yet shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that they had silently fixed on Shayne to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment Shayne began his answer, and as he had glanced from one to
      another of his companions, he evidently understood from their eyes that he
      had permission to speak for all. &ldquo;Mr. Whittaker,&rdquo; he said, with hearty
      frankness, &ldquo;on behalf of myself and my associates I am going to make an
      earnest apology to you for the obstacles we threw in your way at the
      outset of this enterprise. But you must take into account the isolation of
      our lumbering interests and the jealousy we felt at the intrusion of
      outside men and capital. We feared what it might lead to. We have been
      doing business as our fathers did it, and we probably needed this
      awakening that the new railroad has given us. For now that it is built,
      we, as business men, see that the advantages it will afford us are
      desirable in every way. I speak for my friends here when I say that we are
      heartily glad you have beaten us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was jocose yet sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of business&mdash;railroad officials and lumber kings&mdash;broke
      out into a hearty laugh, the laugh of amity and comradeship. Shayne went
      on, more at his ease after that:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we are going to afford you a proof that we mean what we say. We&mdash;this
      party right here&mdash;control fifty miles or more of timber country,
      reaching from here up to the West Branch on both sides, and extending as
      far inland. The river is broken by rapids and falls along this stretch.
      Our drives from up-country are sometimes held up a whole season when a bad
      jam forms in dry times. Every year in dynamiting these jams thousands of
      feet of logs are shattered. More are split on the ledges. We have agreed
      that we need a railroad. Considering our losses, we can afford to pay well
      for having our logs hauled to the smooth water. If you and your friends
      will finance and build such a road, we'll give you free right of way, turn
      over to you annually twenty million feet of timber for your log trains,
      and give you the haul of all our crews and camp supplies. Further than
      that, with spur tracks to lots now inaccessible by water, you can
      quadruple the value of our holdings and your own business at the same
      time. And this will be only the first link of a railroad system that we
      need all through the region. The thing has come to us in its right light
      at last, and we're ready to meet you half-way in everything.&rdquo; He smiled.
      &ldquo;We want the right sort of men behind the scheme, and you have plainly
      showed us that you <i>are</i> the right sort of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      President Whittaker thought a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;I cannot give you a conclusive answer
      to-day, of course, but I can guarantee that no such offer as that is going
      to be refused by my associates and myself. Bring forward your proposition
      in writing. We'll come half-way, too, and be glad of the chance. If men
      and money can accomplish it, a standard gage road will be ready for your
      season's haul next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and touched Parker's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be our representative, with full powers
      to treat with you. Parker, are you ready for two years more in the
      wilderness? It's a big project, and your financial encouragement will be
      correspondingly big. I haven't said yet how thoroughly I appreciate your
      energy and loyalty and self-reliance in the matter of this little
      plaything of the past winter. I do not need to say anything, do I, except
      to urge you to take this new responsibility, and to add that your
      acceptance will encourage me to go ahead at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker reached out his brown hand to meet the one extended to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We also want to say to Mr. Parker,&rdquo; went on Shayne, &ldquo;that on our part
      we'll do more to assist him than we'd do for any other man you could place
      here. We have a little explanation to make to him and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No explanations for me&mdash;if it's along the lines I apprehend, Mr.
      Shayne!&rdquo; cried the young man, jokingly yet meaningly. He bent a
      significant look on the lumber king as he went forward to take his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I keep my own counsels in business matters when I
      can do so without betraying the interests of my employers, and when they
      don't want to be bothered by my personal affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shayne gave the engineer a long stare of honest admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;you never said a word? You're a&mdash;&mdash; Here,
      give me you hand again!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      A half hour later the lumbermen went across the Poquette Carry in a train
      made up of the engine and the coach&mdash;&ldquo;the first real special train
      over the road,&rdquo; Parker said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the young engineer left for his summer vacation, he made a long
      canoe journey up into the Moxie section, ostensibly on a fishing
      expedition. He was gone ten days, a longer period than he had predicted to
      his assistant manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came down the West Branch one afternoon he helped Joshua Ward to
      lift a crippled man out of their canoe, and he carefully directed the
      helpers who carried the unfortunate person to the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid the trip across the carry in a buckboard after the old manner
      would have been too rough for you, Colonel Ward,&rdquo; remarked Parker, as the
      train clanked along under the big trees. &ldquo;I think I was never more glad to
      offer modern conveniences to any traveller across this carry. You
      understand how deep my sincerity is in this, I am positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand everything better than I did, Parker,&rdquo; returned Colonel
      Ward, feelingly, turning away wet eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment in Sunkhaze settlement when the doughty ex-tyrant was
      borne through to the &ldquo;down-country&rdquo; train, accompanied by Parker and
      Joshua, was so intense that only the postmaster recovered himself in
      season to put a few leading questions. After the train had gone he
      announced the results of his findings to the crowd that clustered about
      him on the station platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near's I can find out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that young Parker has been way up into
      the Moxie region an' found old Gid, and spent a week gettin' round him and
      coaxin' him to go 'long with him and Josh to the city, and be fitted to
      new hands and feet, that, so they tell me, is so ingenious a fellow can
      walk round and cut his own victuals and all that. Well, that will help old
      Gid a little. If the blamed old sanup could only be fitted out with a new
      disposition at the same time, we folks round here would be more pleased to
      see him, come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postmaster,&rdquo; cried Dan Connick, who had been one of those who bore the
      colonel from the landing in a chair, &ldquo;don't you ever worry any more about
      a new disposition for Gid Ward. Those things come from the hand of God,
      and Colonel Gid has already been fitted out with the heart and soul of a
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; declared Dodge, gazing to where the smoke wreaths from the
      departing locomotive hung above the distant treetops, &ldquo;I reckon we've just
      seen in bodily shape the passin' of the old in this section as well as the
      comin' of the new.&rdquo;
     </p>
